CONTENTSOVERVIEW

Butterfly* is a group of highly capable, professional attackers who perform corporate 
espionage with a laser-like focus on operational security. The team is a major threat to 
organizations that have large volumes of proprietary intellectual property, all of which is 
at risk of being stolen by this group for monetary gain.

The Butterfly attackers, who Symantec believes are a small number of technically capable 
individuals, compromised several major technology companies including Twitter, Facebook, 
Apple and Microsoft in early 2013. In these campaigns, the attackers used a Java zero-day 
exploit to drop malware onto victims’ computers. 

Since those attacks, there has been little-to-no public information about the Butterfly 
attackers. Symantec has been working with victims to track these attackers over the past 
two years. We found that Butterfly compromised multiple pharmaceutical companies, 
technology firms, law practices, and oil and precious metal mining organizations during  
this period. The attackers are versatile and spread their threats quickly within compromised 
organizations. They may also have had access to at least one other zero-day exploit, 
affecting Internet Explorer 10.

There are some indications that this group may be made up of native English speakers, 
are familiar with Western culture, and may operate from an Eastern Standard Time (EST) 
time zone.

Prior to Butterfly, the majority of documented cyberespionage attacks has been conducted 
against politically sensitive entities such as embassies, government ministries, central 
banks, dissidents, militaries, and associated defense contractors. Government-sponsored 
attackers have also attacked private sector organizations, presumably to steal intellectual 
property in order to provide their local industry with an unfair advantage in the market.

Butterfly is a timely reminder to organizations that as well as defending against 
state-sponsored attacks, organizations must be aware of the potential threat of corporate 
espionage, where attacks are performed at the behest of competitors or by individuals 
looking to monetize stolen information such as through stock trading using insider 
knowledge. A key difference between attacks coming from competitors and state-
sponsored attackers is that competitors are likely in a better position to request the 
theft of specific information of value and make more rapid use of this information than 
government-sponsored attackers would. 

Butterfly appears to be part of this class of attack group. The attackers appear to be 
motivated by financial gain, either by using the information themselves for their own 
benefit or selling it to a third party.

* “Morpho” was used in the original publication to refer to this attack group. Symantec has renamed 
the group “Butterfly” to avoid any link whatsoever to other legitimate corporate entities named 
“Morpho”.

Background

The corporate espionage threat

Prior to Butterfly, the majority of documented cyberespionage attacks has been conducted against politically 
sensitive entities such as embassies, government ministries, central banks, dissidents, militaries, and associated 
defense contractors. Government-sponsored attackers have also attacked private sector organizations, 
presumably to steal intellectual property in order to provide their local industry with an unfair advantage in the 
market.

Butterfly is a timely reminder to organizations that as well as defending against state-sponsored attacks, 
organizations must be aware of the potential threat of corporate espionage, where attacks are performed at the 
behest of competitors or by individuals looking to monetize stolen information such as through stock trading 
using insider knowledge. A key difference between attacks coming from competitors and state-sponsored 
attackers is that competitors are likely in a better position to request the theft of specific information of value 
and make more rapid use of this information than government-sponsored attackers would. 

Butterfly appears to be part of this class of attack group. The attackers appear to be motivated by financial gain, 
either by using the information themselves for their own benefit or selling it to a third party.

Butterfly attacks against tech firms

On February 1, 2013, Twitter published a blog, stating that it had “discovered one live attack” and added that 
it was “able to shut it down in process moments later.” Twitter encouraged users “to disable Java” in their 
browsers. “The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have 
also been recently similarly attacked,” said Twitter.

Fourteen days later, on February 15, Facebook issued a statement, disclosing that several of its systems 
“had been targeted in a sophisticated attack.” Facebook said that the attackers used “a ‘zero-day’ (previously 
unseen) exploit to bypass the Java sandbox,” which had been hosted on a “mobile developer website that was 
compromised.”

Reuters referenced a similar statement from Apple a few days later on February 19. According to Apple, 
attackers used a Java zero-day exploit to compromise a number of Apple employees’ Mac OS X computers. Apple 
said that the exploit was delivered through a “site aimed at iPhone developers.” 

Finally, Microsoft published a statement on February 22, stating that it too had “experienced a similar security 
intrusion” as the ones reported by Facebook and Apple. 

The attacks against these technology firms appeared to take place between 2012 and early 2013. The zero-day 
exploit referred to in the various statements took advantage of the Oracle Java Runtime Environment Multiple 
Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-0422). The vulnerability had been patched by Oracle on 
January 13, 2013, after the attacks occurred. Various parties published details of the attack vector, as well as 
the malware used in the attacks, several days later. 

F-Secure blogged that a Mac OS X back door (detected by Symantec as OSX.Pintsized) was the attack’s payload. 
According to the website StopMalvertising, the compromised website that hosted the exploit was an iPhone 
developer website called iPhoneDevSDK.com. 

Independent researcher Eric Romang published some technical details about the attacks and established a 
timeline suggesting that the attackers have been active from September 2012. Symantec telemetry indicates 
that the timeline goes back even further than this, with malicious activity starting from at least April 2012. 
Romang analyzed many of the OSX.Pintsized samples and also identified a Windows back door, which he claimed 
was related to the attacks. This Windows file is a variant of what Symantec detects as Backdoor.Jiripbot. Other 
vendors called the variant Jripbot.

Since Romang’s analysis, there has been little-to-no public information related to the attackers behind the Java 
zero-day exploit or the use of OSX.Pintsized and Backdoor.Jiripbot.

Victims

After the events of late 2012 and early 2013, the Butterfly attackers appeared to have maintained a low profile, 
compromising a small number of organizations. Each year however, that number has increased. Symantec has 
discovered that the Butterfly attackers have compromised 49 unique organizations. Out of the 49 organizations, 
27 of the companies’ industries could be identified, while the remaining are unknown. 

Some victims 
seem to have been 
compromised as a 
result of collateral 
damage, as the 
attackers appeared 
uninterested in them 
and either cleaned 
up or abandoned the 
infection. However, 
other victims were 
clearly of value to 
Butterfly, as the 
attackers spread 
quickly in the networks 
until they found 
computers of interest. 
The chart in Figure 1 
shows the number of 
infected organizations 
per industry over 
time. The graph is 
filtered to only include 
organizations that 
could be classified into 
a sector.

 Figure 1. Number of infected organizations per industry by year

Symantec found that there was a lull in activity following the very public documentation of the late 2012 and 
early 2013 attacks. Butterfly’s activity resumed in August 2013, and there has been a substantial increase in the 
number of victims from late 2014 to the present. 

The three regions that were 
most heavily targeted by 
Butterfly since 2012 are 
shown in Figure 2.

The other regions affected 
by Butterfly’s attacks are:
•  Brazil
•  China
•  Hong Kong
•  India
•  Israel
•  Japan
•  Kazakhstan
•  Malaysia
•  Morocco
•  Nigeria
•  Taiwan
•  Thailand
•  South Korea
•  United Arab Emirates

The industries of known victims have remained relatively consistent over time, with some notable exceptions. 

Industries

The Java zero-day attack that exploited CVE-2013-0422 appears to have targeted technology companies, judging 
from the nature of the watering-hole website. This claim is backed up by the organizations that publicly reported 
how they were compromised in the attacks. Butterfly has continued to target a number of technology companies, 
which are primarily based in the US. 

Other Butterfly victims of note are involved in the pharmaceutical, legal, and commodities industries. The 
Butterfly attackers continued to attack these industries intermittently over the following two years.
Pharmaceutical
In January 2014, a major European pharmaceutical company was compromised. The attackers appear to have 
first breached a small European office and a month later, spread across the network to the company’s US office, 
as well as the European headquarters. 

Two more major European pharmaceutical companies were later compromised−one in September 2014 and 
the other in June 2015. In both incidents, the attackers appear to have gained access to computers in several 
regional offices. In the June 2015 compromise, the affected company quickly identified the infection from 
Symantec’s alerts, as well as other notifications on Secure Shell (SSH) traffic on non-standard ports. 
Technology
The Butterfly attackers have consistently targeted major technology companies from late 2012 to the present. 
At least five companies, in addition to those who publicly documented the attacks in 2013, have been 
compromised, to Symantec’s knowledge. The technology companies are primarily headquartered in the US. 
Law
In the watering-hole attacks of early 2012, two US-based law firms were attacked. No other known legal entities 
were attacked until June 
2015, when the Central Asian 
offices of a global law firm 
were compromised. This most 
recent victim specializes in a 
number of topics, including 
finance and natural resources 
specific to the region.  
Commodities
Two major natural 
resources organizations 
were compromised in late 
2014. These organizations 
specifically work with gold 
and oil. The timing of these 
compromises, along with the 
later breach of the law firm 
as previously mentioned, is 
notable. It seems very likely 
that the Butterfly attackers 
have a specific interest in the 
commodities industry and are 
in a position to profit from 
information stolen from the 
breached organizations. 

 Figure 3. Timeline showing when attacks against different industry sectors began

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

Government, logistics, and education
A number of victims appear to have been of little interest to the attackers. This was the case for one Middle 
Eastern government agency, a Japanese logistics company, and an American university. With all three victims, 
either the attack was not successful or, if it was, the malware was not used after the initial compromise. It seems 
likely that these victims were collateral damage.

Targeted computers

The attackers focused on obtaining access to specific systems of interest in all of the compromised 
organizations. In most organizations, these systems were email servers: either Microsoft Exchange or Lotus 
Domino servers. Once the attackers had this access, they presumably then eavesdropped on email conversations 
and may have been in a position to potentially insert fraudulent emails as well. 

Other systems that the attackers compromised were enterprise content management servers. These systems are 
used for indexing and storing a company’s various documents and other digital assets. Such servers would not 
contain source code, but rather legal documents, internal policies, training documents, product descriptions, 
and financial records.

In one technology company breach, Butterfly compromised a more unusual system. The attackers gained access 
to what is known as a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system. This software is used for 
aggregating, managing, and monitoring physical security systems and devices. The physical security systems 
could consist of CCTV, swipe card access, HVAC, and other building security. After compromised that system, the 
attackers could have monitored employees through the company’s own CCTV systems and tracked the activities 
of individuals within the building. 

Tools, tactics, and procedures

Butterfly operates consistently across its breaches, deploying the same set of tools and targeting the same 
types of computers, which we detail in the Victims section of this report. Butterfly adapts quickly to targeted 
environments and takes advantage of systems already in place, such as remote access tools or management 
systems, in order to spread across the network.

While Butterfly has used one confirmed zero-day exploit (CVE-2013-0422), the group appears to have used at 
least one more zero-day exploit against a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 10. 

Based on our analysis of a command-and-control (C&C) server used in an attack, the Butterfly operators 
demonstrate exceptional operational security, as they use encrypted virtual machines and multi-staged C&C 
servers to make it difficult to investigate their activities. 

Gaining initial access

The attack vector for Butterfly’s campaigns in late 2012 and early 2013 was well documented. The group 
conducted a watering-hole attack that compromised a popular mobile phone developer website, iPhoneDevSDK.
com, to deliver a Java zero-day exploit. However, little information is known about how the Butterfly attackers 
have continued to gain access to victims’ systems, except for a few cases. 

In one of the most serious cases, on June 25, 2014, Internet Explorer 10 created a file called bda9.tmp 
on a victim’s computer. It is likely that bda9.tmp was created as a result of an exploit targeting Internet 
Explorer. Bda9.tmp was then executed and went on to create a variant of Backdoor.Jiripbot with the file name 
LiveUpdate.exe. 

The affected version of Internet Explorer was a fully up-to-date, patched version of the browser, so the exploit 
was very likely either a zero-day for Internet Explorer 10 or for a plugin used in Internet Explorer. 

Microsoft patched a number of Internet Explorer 10 remote code execution vulnerabilities in subsequent Patch 

Page 10

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

Tuesday releases. It is possible that one of these patches covered the exploit, as there is no additional evidence 
of an Internet Explorer 10 exploit in use. It was not possible to identify the website hosting the exploit or to 
retrieve a copy of the exploit.

In late 2014, Java was used to create a file called updt.dat on a system belonging to another targeted 
organization. The updt.dat file was located in a JBossweb folder, which is a sub-folder of Apache Tomcat. Based 
on this activity, it seems likely that the JBoss server was compromised to deploy the malware. The breach may 
have been a result of an SQL injection attack. This is based on evidence from an analyzed C&C server, where we 
discovered that the Butterfly attackers use the SQLMap tool against their targets. 

Once Butterfly gains a foothold in the victim’s network, they begin to carefully spread through it, until they 
locate a system of interest. 

Spreading

In at least two incidents, the attackers appear to have taken advantage of internal systems to spread through 
a network once they gained initial access. In one instance, the attackers used a Citrix profile management 
application to create a back door on a newly infected system. This application can be used to install applications 
or manage a user’s profile for authentication. It’s likely that the attackers took advantage of this system and 
placed the back door in a specific profile, which was triggered when the profile’s owner logged in. 

In the second incident, the TeamViewer application was used to create copies of Backdoor.Jiripbot on the 
compromised computers. It appears that TeamViewer was legitimately present on the targeted computers and 
was then taken advantage of by the attackers. 

However the attackers spread within a network, they are able to move quickly. In one breach, the attackers first 
compromised a computer on April 16, 2014. Within one day, they compromised three more computers. Once a 
computer is infected, the attackers seem to rapidly determine whether or not the computer is valuable to them. 

There are two instances where there was no additional Butterfly activity after the computers were infected, apart 
from the creation of shred.exe. In these cases, the attackers likely determined that the infected computers were 
not valuable targets and used shred.exe to securely remove the infections.

The Butterfly toolkit

The Butterfly attackers use a number of different tools, a subset of which has been retrieved from compromised 
computers. This set of tools appears to be unique to the attackers, as the tools have been in use in combination 
with each other and there has been no open source data on the various tools used. 

The attackers use the hacking tools once they gain a foothold on a network. They generally give the tools .dat 
extensions and file names that usually give some indication of the tools’ purposes. For example, the attackers 
refer to one of the tools as “Banner Jack” and deploy it with the name bj.dat. It is likely that these files are 
encrypted when they are downloaded and are then decrypted when on disk. 

Known hashes and corresponding file names are listed in the appendix under the Hashes section. A number of 
the hacking tools also contain help documentation, which details how to use the tool. Each help description is 
listed in the appendix, where present.
OSX.Pintsized and Hacktool.Securetunnel
The back door OSX.Pintsized was well documented by F-Secure, Intego, and Romang after the 2012/2013 tech 
company attacks. OSX.Pintsized is a modification of OpenSSH that runs on Mac OS X, and contains additional 
code to read two new arguments and an embedded RSA key. The two additional arguments are “-z” and “-p”, 
which are used to pass a C&C server address and port respectively. The back door has also been observed using 
a very basic Perl script that opens a reverse shell.

Page 11

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

The Butterfly attackers use the same modified version of OpenSSH on 32-bit Windows systems. This version uses 
the exact same “-z” and “-p” additional arguments and also includes an embedded RSA key. The attackers have 
two versions: one which is statically linked against OpenSSH and the other which is compiled using a Cygwin 
DLL. Symantec detects these samples as Hacktool.Securetunnel. 
Backdoor.Jiripbot
Romang referenced a malware family called Backdoor.Jiripbot (aka Jripbot) in his blog. This is the Butterfly 
group’s primary back door tool, which has a fallback domain generation algorithm (DGA) for maintaining 
command and control. A comprehensive technical description of this malware family is provided in the appendix. 

One notable point about Backdoor.Jiripbot is the use of the string “AYBABTU” as an encryption key. This is the 
acronym for “All your base are belong to us”, a popular meme used by gamers. 

The attackers have used several variants of this malware family from 2013 to at least June of 2015, with several 
minor modifications adding or removing commands. 
Hacktool.Bannerjack
Hacktool.Bannerjack is used to retrieve default messages issued by Telnet, HTTP, and generic Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP) servers. The help documentation for the tool is listed in the appendix. The tool takes 
an IP address range and port. It then connects to each IP address on a given port, retrieving and logging any 
data printed by the server. The tool is presumably used to locate any potentially vulnerable servers on the local 
network, likely including printers, routers, HTTP servers, and any other generic TCP servers. 
Hacktool.Multipurpose
Hacktool.Multipurpose also appears to be a custom-developed tool. It is designed to assist attackers in 
spreading through a network. It hides activity by editing events logs, dumping passwords, securely deleting files, 
encrypting files, and performing basic network enumeration. 

The help documentation for this tool is quite comprehensive and extensively explains the tool’s functionality. 
This documentation is listed in the appendix. 
Hacktool.Eventlog
Hacktool.Eventlog is another multipurpose tool, but its primary functionality is to parse event logs, dumping out 
ones of interest, and to delete entries. The tool will also end processes and perform a secure self-delete. The help 
documentation for the tool is listed in the appendix. 
Hacktool.Proxy.A
Hacktool.Proxy.A creates a proxy connection that allows attackers to route traffic through an intermediary node 
onto their destination node. The documentation for the tool is listed in the appendix.

Operational security

The Butterfly attackers have demonstrated excellent operational security, as we have observed in several 
aspects of their attacks.

The Butterfly attackers use a number of anti-forensics techniques to prevent detection and presumably hinder 
investigation into their activity when discovered. The group’s malware and other files are securely deleted using 
either the GNU Shred tool, which overwrites a file’s contents as well as deleting the index from the file allocation 

Page 12

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

table, or the shred functionality written into a custom tool. Similarly, event logs are modified to remove any 
evidence of the attackers’ activity. A specific tool, Hacktool.Eventlog, appears to have been developed to perform 
just this function. Using both techniques, the attackers can securely remove infections from computers that are 
of no interest, letting them avoid leaving any trace of activity.

Another aspect of Butterfly’s operational security is the use of throwaway registrant names for C&C domains. 
There appears to be no re-use of email addresses or names when registering different domains and C&C servers. 
Similarly, the Butterfly attackers use bitcoins to pay hosting providers to host their C&C servers. This method of 
payment makes it difficult for investigators to track the transaction back to a particular entity. 

Finally, one of the most telling aspects of the Butterfly attackers’ level of operational security is how they run 
their C&C servers. Symantec performed a forensic analysis of a C&C server used by the Butterfly attackers in late 
2014. These attackers typically use a multi-staged C&C infrastructure, with several servers acting as proxies and 
redirecting connections back to a final server. Symantec believes that the analyzed server was this final server, 
however, it was not possible to confirm this. 

The analyzed server was running Debian Linux and was very clean, with little traces of activity. Logging had been 
disabled and any log files that had been created before logging was disabled were securely deleted. A single file 
was present in the /root/ directory. This file, called “hd-porn-corrupted_tofix.rar”, was 400GB in size. Despite 
the .rar extension, it was not a .rar file. However, there were some indications on the server as to what this file 
actually was. 

Truecrypt was installed on the server, as was Virtual Box. Truecrypt is an encryption tool that can be used to 
create an encrypted file system in a single file. Virtual Box is software that can be used to run a virtual machine. 
It is likely that the 400GB “.rar” file was an encrypted Truecrypt file which contains a Virtual Box virtual machine. 
The Butterfly attackers would decrypt and run the virtual machine, redirecting SSH traffic from the physical 
hosting server to the virtual machine. This would give the attackers the ability to control compromised systems 
from within the virtual machine. This type of design is effective at hindering analysis without a live memory 
image of the C&C server. 

There were other hints of activity on the C&C server as well. There was evidence to suggest that the attackers 
used the SQLMap tool. This tool looks for SQL weaknesses in web applications, and indeed, as previously 
mentioned, at least one victim was compromised through a JBoss server, possibly through an SQL injection 
attack. Also, the local time zone of the C&C server was changed to New York, UTC-5. 

However, apart from the SQLMap activity and the modified time zone, there was no other evidence on the C&C 
server. The Butterfly attackers maintained a very clean house. 

Page 13

Attribution

Based on the gathered evidence, there are several plausible theories that describe the nature of the Butterfly 
attackers. A summary of some of the data gathered is presented below: 
•  Victims are primarily large corporations, mostly related to technology, pharmaceutical, commodities, and law. 
•  The targeted technology companies are mostly based in the US, however, other victims are spread across the 

globe. 

•  There is one government victim
•  Infection numbers are generally quite low; there are not many concurrent infections
•  Activity remains consistent across infected organizations; the attackers use same file names and deploy the 

same tools 

•  The group has excellent operational security
•  The attackers have had access to at least one zero-day exploit, likely two and possibly more.
•  The attackers appear to develop their own tools.
•  The group’s various hacktools have extensive documentation written in good English.
•  Several memes or colloquialisms specific to English speakers are used
•  “All your bases are belong to us”–The AYBABTU encryption key in Backdoor.Jiripbot
•  “Stuffz”–A phrase used in the Hacktool.Multipurpose description
•  “Zap”–To mean delete, used in the Hacktool.Eventlog description
•  The time zone of the C&C server is set to EST 
The nature of the observed victims indicates that it’s likely that Butterfly attackers’ motivation is not for national 
security intelligence, but rather for financial purposes. While there is one government victim, this likely appears 
to be collateral damage.

As the hack tools include detailed documentation, it’s likely that there is more than one person performing 
the attacks, as a single attacker would not need to document their own tools. Based on the few concurrent 
infections, Butterfly may be made up of a small number of attackers, perhaps between three and ten people. 
It is also easier to maintain good operational security with a small number of people. 

The attackers are well resourced, given that they have access to at least one zero-day (the Java exploit), and 
possibly more (potential Internet Explorer 10 zero-day exploit). Their access to zero-day exploits implies that 
they either have the funding to purchase a zero-day or the technical skills to identify and exploit undiscovered 
vulnerabilities. 

If the Butterfly group is small, then it would make more sense to utilize people with a general skill set, rather 
than individuals who specialize in exploit discovery. This implies that the purchase of zero-day exploits is more 
likely. Along with this, if Butterfly is a professional group of hackers who work against deadlines and has internal 
goals, that would imply the need to be able to access zero-day exploits on demand. That would mean purchasing 
them, rather than waiting for a team member to discover one. 

At least some of the Butterfly attackers appear to be native English speakers, based on the help documentation 
in the hack tools and the use of memes and colloquialisms. It is possible that these English speakers are based in 
the US, judging from the time zone set on the C&C server. However, this seems like a very basic mistake for the 
attackers to make, considering how they have demonstrated great attention to detail in most aspects of 
their operations. 

Some attribution theories that may fit the evidence and conclusions are as follows:
•  This is economic espionage by a government agency 
•  This is an organization made up of hackers-for-hire
•  This is an organization with a single customer 
A government agency is the least likely of these theories, given the number of victims that span across various 
geopolitical boundaries and the lack of targeting of any victims that are related to traditional 
intelligence-gathering. It is far more likely that the Butterfly attackers are an organization of individuals working 
closely together to either steal intellectual property for another client or for their own financial gain, for example 
through the stock market.

CONCLUSIONOrganizations need to be aware of the threat that corporate espionage groups like Butterfly can pose. Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

Conclusion

Butterfly is a skilled, persistent, and effective attack group which has been active since at least March 2012. 
They are well resourced, using at least one or possibly two zero-day exploits. Their motivation is very likely 
to be financial gain and given that they have been active for at least three years, they must be successful at 
monetizing their operation. 

Based on our analysis, the Butterfly attackers are likely a small team that steals data either as a service to 
another client or to monetize it themselves through insider trading. Symantec believes that some members of 
Butterfly are native English speakers, given some of the colloquialisms and Western meme references included 
in their infrastructure. 

The Butterfly attackers represent a threat to organizations involved in technology, pharmaceutical, law, 
investment, energy and natural resources. However, over the past three years, the attackers have demonstrated 
that they can change their targets quickly, as they moved to include commodities in their list of targets in 2014. 
Clearly, the Butterfly attackers will go where the money is. 

Organizations need to be aware of the threat that corporate espionage groups like Butterfly can pose. The attack 
group or their potential clients may have strong knowledge on how to leverage the stolen data to unfairly make 
gains in the market.

Back door

To perform any activity, the samples need to be executed with a command line argument that begins with ‘http’. 
This value is encrypted and stored in the registry; the registry location varies based on the sample. Each sample 
first encrypts the URL using RC4 with a hard-coded key. It should be noted that the hard-coded key is stored in 
the binary as a wide character string, but is converted to a multibyte character string before the key is used. 
This conversion will vary based on the region of the system executing the code.

The malware takes exactly one command line argument, but the single command line argument has a structure 
that is manually parsed by the malware. The structure of the command line argument is as follows:

“http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts opt=val,opt=val...”

Where “opt” is one of the following:
•  vm: Set to a number. “2” will disable vmware checks
•  proxy_username: HTTP proxy user name to use
•  proxy_password: HTTP proxy password to use
•  proxy_host: HTTP proxy host to use
•  proxy_port: HTTP proxy port to use
•  resolv: Host name to resolve to
•  delay: Number of delay loops to execute
•  sleeptime: Number of seconds to sleep at certain points in the code
•  cnx: Parameter that modifies how C&C server is interacted with
Once the URL from the command line is RC4-encrypted, it is encrypted a second time using the 
crypt32!CryptProtectData API, with “OptionalEntropy” set to the ASCII string ‘AYBABTU’ (this is the acronym for 
the phrase “All your base are belong to us”). The use of crypt32!CryptProtectData ensures that if the encrypted 
data is retrieved from an infected computer, it is very hard to decrypt the data on another computer. The 
documentation for crypt32!CryptProtectData states:

“Typically, only a user with the same logon credential as the user who encrypted the data can decrypt the data.”

Next the malware examines its execution environment. It first checks to make sure that the file name it is 
currently running under is the same as the original name when the executable was created. It also looks for 
certain process names of running processes. The process names it searches for are hashed, so we are not clear 
what it is looking for.

It checks that the hashed value of the registry subkey HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\
CurrentVersion\ProductId is not equal to a number of hashed values. It checks the hashed values of the registry

keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE against a list of hashes. It also checks the registry subkeysHKEY_
LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Disk\Enum and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\
DESCRIPTION\System\BIOS\SystemProductName

‘resolv’ command

When the resolv command line argument is set to a domain name, a domain name system (DNS) resolution 
request is made for that domain name with the current computer name and calculated UID value prepended to 
it.

For example, we observed the following:

resolv=h30026.drfx.chickenkiller.com

When the sample is run with resolv set to that value, the following DNS query was observed: 

thread-2d9f4de5.1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350.h30026.drfx.
chickenkiller.com

In this query, “thread-2d9f4de5” is the computer name and 
“1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350” is the calculated UID value. It is possible that the 
attackers use this method to exfiltrate the UID value, as the value is used in the DGA algorithm.

UID/UPDATE_ID calculation

The UID is a unique ID calculated by the malware, as the following example shows:

1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350

This ID consists of the following elements:
•  14014: Hard-coded string in the malware. May be a version number
•  2: The operating system version
•  0: 0 indicates x86, 1 indicates x86_64
•  000c29bfea70: This is the last six bytes of the UUID generated by a call to rpcrt4!UuidCreateSequential. This 

corresponds to the media access control (MAC) address of the infected computer.
•  f49b94b8: This is the first eight bytes of the volume serial number from a call to 

kernel32!GetVolumeInfomationW

•  25e3e758: This is a dword hash of the string “[COMPUTER NAME]\[USER NAME]” using the current values 

from the computer name and user name

•  6ce61350: This is a hard-coded dword in the binary
For the operating system (the number at offset 5 in previous UID example), the complete table is:
•  0: Unknown/Error/Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2012 R2
•  1: Windows 2000
•  2: Windows XP
•  3: Windows 2003, Windows XP Pro x64, Windows Home Server, Windows 2003 R2
•  4: Windows Vista
•  5: Windows Server 2008
•  6: Windows 7
•  7: Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012
•  8: Windows 8

Installation
The following registry subkeys may be used by Butterfly to maintain persistence: 
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Preferences
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Options
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\UID

Page 20

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Acer\UPDATE_ID
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Acer\Preferences
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Acer\Options
•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Acer LiveUpdater (likely named 

Liveupdater.exe)

•  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Adobe Flash Plugin Updater  

(FlashUtil.exe)

The registry data stored in the “Preferences” and “Options” subkeys are REG_BINARY keys and the data within is 
encrypted using RC4 and crypt32!CryptProtectData, as described previously. The registry data stored in the UID 
is not encrypted; it is stored in plain text.

The value of “Preferences” is the encrypted version of the first command line argument used to first start the 
malware. For example, if the malware is launched as:

FlashUtil.exe “http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts vm=2”

The value of “Preferences” will be:

“http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts vm=2.”

The value of “Options” is the URL from the command line argument, so for the previous example, the value 
would be:

“http://[DOMAIN NAME].com”

Networking

DGA Algorithm

The DGA computes a URL similar to the following:
•  http://jdk.MD5([MM].[YYYY].[UID AS WIDE-CHARACTER STRING]).org 
[MM] is the current month and [YYYY] is the current year. Note that the value of [UID AS WIDE-CHARACTER 
STRING] is the value of the UID registry entry, but as a wide characters, so “07.2014.140...” would be “0\x007\
x00.\x002\x000\x001\x004\x00.\x001\x004\x000\x00...” for the purposes of the MD5 calculation.

For example, on July 22, 2014 on a system with the UID set to 
“1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350”, the DGA URL would be:
•  http://jdk.MD5(\’07.2014.1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350\’).org
Finally:
•  http://jdk.20e8ad99287f7fc244651237cbe8292a.org
Note that some samples use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

C&C commands

The following commands implement back door functionality.
•  cd: Changes current working directory
•  exec: Executes a file using cmd.exe
•  install: Sets the registry subkey for persistence. The registry subkey is only set if this command is sent
•  quit: Ends the back door session
•  sleeptime: Sets the sleep time between C&C queries
•  shred: Overwrites file multiple times to perform a forensic-safe delete. Only found in samples with a PE 

timestamp in 2014

•  sysinfo: Gathers and reports system information
•  uninstall: Uninstalls itself

Page 21

Butterfly: Corporate spies out for financial gain

•  update: Updates itself
•  url: Updates C&C URL in registry (although this feature appears to be disabled)
•  wget: Downloads file to infected computer
Decryption keys

The following MD5s used the corresponding keys for decryption:
•  95ffe4ab4b158602917dd2a999a8caf8: 0xb4
•  531f2014a2a9ba4ddf3902418be23b52: 0xa9
•  a0132c45e8afe84091b7b5bf75da9037: 0xa9
•  1d5f0018921f29e8ee2e666137b1ffe7: 0xa9
There is a string in all of the binaries equal to “la revedere”, which is “goodbye” in Romanian.

File hashes 

Many of the hashes listed in Table 2 are for clean files which are used by the Butterfly attackers. Do not use any 
marked with “N/A” or “Clean” files in any automated detection system. They are provided merely as potential 
indicators of compromise, not as definitively malicious files.
