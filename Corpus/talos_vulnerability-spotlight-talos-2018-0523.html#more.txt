Vulnerability Spotlight: TALOS-2018-0523-24 - Multiple Vulnerabilities in Pixars Renderman application



Vulnerabilities discovered by Tyler Bohan from Talos 



Overview

Talos is disclosing two denial-of-service vulnerabilities in Pixar’s Renderman application. Renderman is a rendering application used in animation and film production. It is widely used for advanced rendering and shading in many large-scale environments. Both vulnerabilities are due to the lack of proper validation during the parsing process of network packets.

Pixar remedied  these vulnerabilities in RenderMan version 21.7 

  

 

Details

TALOS-2018-0523 / CVE-2018-3840

An attacker could send a malformed TCP packet to port 4001 using the ‘0x67’ command that is not followed by one of the four values (0x00 - 0x03) permitted for the subsequent byte. Due to a lack of input validation, a null pointer dereference is caused, as well as a denial of service. You can read more details in the Talos Vulnerability Report.


TALOS-2018-0524 / CVE-2018-3841

This vulnerability is caused by a very similar issue as described in TALOS-2018-0523. The only difference is that a potential attacker supplies a packet containing the ‘0x69’ command, followed by more than one byte of data to trigger the vulnerability. You can read more details in the Talos Vulnerability Report.
