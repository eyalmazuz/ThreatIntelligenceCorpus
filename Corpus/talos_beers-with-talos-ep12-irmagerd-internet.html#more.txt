EP12 Show Notes: 
Matt runs the ship this week in Mitch’s absence. Craig and Nigel are joined by Bill Largent and Joel was… in a meeting?  The crew discusses ambulance chasing and crying wolf in the security industry and also what the security press is doing to perpetuate questionable reporting.  We also chat at length about what exactly goes into vulnerability discovery, chaining exploits, and the months of work to get to those “12 seconds” of glory at Pwn2Own.Did we mention the internet ate our last podcast? Sorry about that.  We do our best to make up for missing a week this time. But man, that was a great episode you missed…
