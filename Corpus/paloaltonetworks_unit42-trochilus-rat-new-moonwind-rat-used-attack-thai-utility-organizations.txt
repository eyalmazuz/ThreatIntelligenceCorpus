Trochilus and New MoonWind RATs Used In Attack Against Thai Organizations

From September 2016 through late November 2016, a threat actor group used both the Trochilus RAT and a newly idenfied RAT we’ve named MoonWind to target organizations in Thailand, including a utility organization. We chose the name ‘MoonWind’ based on debugging strings we saw within the samples, as well as the compiler used to generate the samples. The attackers compromised two legitimate Thai websites to host the malware, which is a tactic this group has used in the past. Both the Trochilus and MoonWind RATs were hosted on the same compromised sites and used to target the same organization at the same time. The attackers used different command and control servers (C2s) for each malware family, a tactic we believe was meant to thwart attempts to tie the attacks together using infrastructure alone. The compromised websites are the site for a group of information technology companies in Thailand, and all the tools were stored in the same directory.
We were also able to find a post-compromise tool along with the two RATs, which afforeded us insight into one of the tools the attackers used once they gained a foothold inside an organization. In addition to Trochilus and MoonWind we found Mimikatz, a popular credential harvesting tool.
Further research led us to additional MoonWind samples using the same C2 (dns[.] webswindows [.]com) but hosted on a different compromised but legitimate website.  The attacks in that case took place in late September to early October 2016 and the attackers stored the MoonWind samples as RAR files, while in the November attacks the RATs were stored as executables. We were not able to find additional tools, but the attackers again compromised a legitimate Thai website to host their malware, in this case the student portal for a Thai University.
MoonWind Analysis
The MoonWind sample used for this analysis was compiled with a Chinese compiler known as BlackMoon, the same compiler used for the BlackMoon banking Trojan. While a number of attributes match the BlackMoon banking Trojan, the malware is not the same. Both malware families were simply compiled using the same compiler, and it was the BlackMoon artifacts that resulted in the naming of the BlackMoon banking Trojan. But because this new sample is different from the BlackMoon banking Trojan, we have named it MoonWind, by combining the BlackMoon compiler artifacts with the embedded string below:
E:\StarWind\FW__Project_RTPD-PIBICs\Table.ini
When MoonWind first runs, it will copy itself to one of the following locations with a filename of ‘svcohos.exe’:

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Ufyaginptxb\
C:\Users\All Users\
C:\PorgramData\
C:\Program Files\Common Files\

It then executes a new instance of itself in a new process. Also, it will remove the original file via the following command that is executed in a batch script named ‘date.bat’.




cmd /c timeout /t 6 & del "C:\ProgramData\Ufyaginptxb\svcohost.exe" & del date.bat




1

cmd /c timeout /t 6 & del "C:\ProgramData\Ufyaginptxb\svcohost.exe" & del date.bat





During this routine, a randomly generated victim identifier will be created and written to a file named ‘micr.ini’. This file is located in the same path as the malware. The following contents represent an example of a victim ID contained in this file:




[mic]
Mic=2199LLLLLL




12

[mic]Mic=2199LLLLLL





During the install routine, the malware will also setup a timer that will execute a file named ‘sevrsvos.exe’. This sample (815df680be80b26b5dff0bcaf73f7495b9cae5e3ad3acb7348be188af3e75201) acts as a runtime persistence mechanism. It installs itself as a service with the following properties:
Service Name: Windows  Ejlptxtxbfjn Rvzd
Display Name: Windows  Ejlptxtxbfjn Rvzd
Description: Windows  Ejlptxtxbfjn Rvzd Hlptxbfjnr
Startup Type: Automatic
This service serves the single purpose of checking every 60 seconds if the ‘svcohos.exe’ process is running. If not, the service will spawn a new instance of it. In doing so, this secondary malware sample acts as both a runtime persistence mechanism, as well as a persistence mechanism across reboots.
After installation, a keylogging routine begins. The malware writes keystrokes and window information to a filename in the present working directory with the following filename:
jop[year][month][day][hour][minute][seconds].zip
Additionally, it writes a ‘win.ini’ file that contains this file path above.
The malware proceeds to collect the following victim information:

Hostname
Username
Windows version
IP address
Current time
RAM amount
Number of total drives
Number of removable drives
Unique victim identifier

After this information is aggregated, MoonWind enters its command and control loop, and begins reaching out to the servers and ports specified in its configuration embedded in the svcohos.exe file. The following remote hosts were specified in this particular sample:
dns.webswindows[.]com|80
dns.webswindows[.]com|443
dns.webswindows[.]com|53
dns.webswindows[.]com|8080
While the ports associated with this sample’s configuration pertain normally to HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS, network communication takes place via raw sockets. The malware first receives data, which has the following format as shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1 C2 to MoonWind communication
Digging into the packet further, we can break out individual pieces, as seen in Figure 2:

Figure 2 MoonWind network communication packet format
The encrypted data portion is encrypted via RC4 with the following static key:
HHSADh!@#$YUAGEWYGhjfsjd5465fsaQWAFGDA/jfdafdjhhasgfh==
In the above example, the encrypted data decrypts to ‘\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20’, or six spaces. This particular command requests that the malware send the previously collected victim information.
The data returned by MoonWind has the same format, however, uses the following static key for encryption instead:
SSHqWSSAFdhjklfahj!@##4*&&!!HQ12785452!@!!$$$32#@$$11!!
An example of such data returned by the malware can be seen below in figure 3.

Figure 3 MoonWind to C2 communication
When decrypted, we see the data shown in Figure 4. Note that the first six bytes contains the return command (‘WYR002’), followed by the payload. The payload contains information previously discussed, delimited by ‘*/*’. Certain variables, such as ‘cdg’ and ‘ip’ are hardcoded. We also see what is most likely a malware versioning string at the end (V2.1). This string is also hardcoded to the sample.

Figure 4 Decrypted data sent by MoonWind
In total, MoonWind has 73 possibly commands that it can accept. We have not yet fully researched all of the commands, but the majority of them have been identified, as we can see in the Appendix.
Conclusion
Trochilus was first reported by Arbor Networks in their Seven Pointed Dagger report tying its use to other targeted Southeast Asia activity. The activity dates to at least 2013 and has ties to multiple reports by other researchers. It is highly likely MoonWind is yet another new tool being used by the group or groups responsible for that activity, indicating they are not only still active but continuing to evolve their playbook.
