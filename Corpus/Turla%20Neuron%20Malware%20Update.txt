Introduction 
 

In November 2017, the NCSC released an advisory highlighting the Turla Group’s use 
of the tools Neuron and Nautilus.1 

Since then, the NCSC has identified a new version of the Neuron malware. The new 
version has been modified to evade previous detection methods. 

Neuron operates on Microsoft Windows platforms, primarily targeting mail servers and 
web  servers.  The  NCSC  has  observed  this  tool  being  used  by  the  Turla  group  to 
maintain persistent network access and to conduct network operations. 

The  compile  times  contained  within  these  new  binaries  show  that  the  actor 
implemented the required modifications to Neuron approximately five days after public 
releases by the NCSC and other vendors. 

This NCSC report provides new intelligence on the Neuron malware, a tool used by 
the Turla group to target the UK. It contains IOCs and signatures for  to be used for 
network monitoring and detection. 

 
The files analysed in this report are available on VirusTotal. 

 

Summary of changes to Neuron malware 
 

•  The .NET payload is loaded in-memory as opposed to being dropped to disk; 

 

•  Communications have been modified to avoid detection; 

 

•  Some encryption methods have replaced RC4 with AES; 

 

•  The modifications are sufficient to avoid previously released signatures & 

IOCs.

Neuron Updates 
 

A sample of Neuron was recently uploaded to VirusTotal. This sample appears to be 
an updated version of Neuron. Changes have primarily been made to the dropper and 
loading mechanisms. 

The  PDB  string  embedded  within  the  binary  supports  the  assumption  that  this  is  a 
newer version by referring to itself as “neuron2”. 

D:\Develop\sps\neuron2\x64\Release\dcomnet.pdb 

 
This  sample  contains  sufficient  modifications  to  frustrate  detection,  allowing  Turla 
operations to continue. 

 

Loader 
 

With  previous  versions  of  Neuron,  a  native  dropper  was  utilised  to  write  the  main 
payload to disk, establish persistence and ensure execution. This latest version uses 
a native x64 loader to execute the .NET payload in-memory. The payload is encrypted 
within  the  loader,  which  ensures  the  payload  never  touches  disk  in  plaintext.  This 
modification has likely been made to evade detection during disk scans performed by 
anti-virus  products,  however  anti-virus  products  that  scan  memory  will  still  likely  be 
able to detect the payload running. 

The loader has the required exports to enable the configuration as a service, therefore 
it's believed this will be the method used for persistence. 

The loader can also specify which endpoints (HTTP(S) or pipe) to listen on by passing 
them to the .NET executable as arguments. In this sample the endpoints specified are 
different to previous versions: 

•  http://*:80/OWA/OAB/ 
•  https://*:443/OWA/OAB/ 

If no arguments are provided the payload will use the following defaults for HTTP(S) 
or pipes: 

•  http://*:80/W3SVC/ 
•  https://*:443/W3SVC/ 
•  pipe://*/Winsock2/baseapi_http 

Error handling has been added to the new payload. If the webserver encounters an 
exception it will attempt to use the default values above, if another exception occurs 
then the payload will revert to using the default HTTP (port 80) value.

Payload 
 
The main payload is still a .NET executable, but several modifications have been made 
to its operation which are described below 

 

Encryption 
 

Previous versions of Neuron used  RC4 for the encryption of data  stored on disk or 
sent over the network. Portions of the updated Neuron service have been migrated to 
AES,  however,  some  components  still  rely  on  the  RC4  implementation,  such  as 
encrypting command information. 

The actors have configured multiple hardcoded encryption keys rather than using one 
for everything. For example, one is used for normal communication between nodes, 
and another is used if the node is proxying a request. These modifications are likely 
implemented to make detection and decryption by network defenders more difficult. 

 

Communications 
 

The communication between clients and servers has also changed to avoid detection. 
The server expects a POST request, but rather than using the previous pre-defined 
parameter names (cid, cadata etc.), the new function loops through each parameter 
looking  for  certain  characters  within  that  parameter’s  value  to  determine  what 
functionality should be performed. This will allow the parameter names to be randomly 
generated and/or regularly changed, making it more difficult for network defenders to 
reliably detect communications. 

As  an  example,  the  following  characters  are  looked  for  (in  the  order  shown)  to 
determine which functionality should be performed: 

Character

( and ) 

Return list of storage files
