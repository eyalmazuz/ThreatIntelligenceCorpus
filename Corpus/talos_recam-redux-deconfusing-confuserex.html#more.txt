Recam Redux - DeConfusing ConfuserEx






This post is authored by Holger Unterbrink and Christopher Marczewski





Overview
This report shows how to deobfuscate a custom .NET ConfuserEx protected 
malware. We identified this recent malware campaign in our Advanced 
Malware Protection (AMP) telemetry. Initial infection is via a malicious
 Word document, the malware ultimately executes in memory an embedded 
payload from the Recam family. Recam is an information stealer. Although
 the malware has been around for the past few years, there's a reason 
you won't see a significant amount of documentation concerning its 
internals. The authors have gone the extra mile to delay analysis of the
 sample, including multiple layers of data encryption, string 
obfuscation, piecewise nulling, and data buffer constructors. It also 
relies on its own C2 binary protocol which is heavily encrypted along 
with any relevant data before transmission.





Technical Details 

The Dropper
The word document (see above) uses common malware techniques, such as embedded VB 
code, to drop a .NET executable. We will not discuss these techniques 
further, but concentrate on the  deobfuscation of the .NET malware 
dropper. The dropper is heavily obfuscated with a custom version of 
ConfuserEx, a free .NET Framework protector. On opening the binary in a .NET 
decompiler like dnSpy it is initially unreadable (see Fig. 1).



Fig. 1


There are a number of free deobfuscators available for ConfuserEx 
protected binaries; however, none of them are effective for this 
malware. Only some parts are able to be deobfuscated using these 
automated tools, leaving important sections of the binary unchanged, and
 breaking execution. This means we have no choice but to do it the hard 
way and deobfuscate it manually. There is documentation for manually 
unpacking ConfuserEx, but unfortunately, we hit bad luck again. The 
available documentation doesn't work with this version.

To get started, we first load the 
binary into dnSpy. We go to the <Module>. cctor and set a 
breakpoint on the last method (Fig 2). Now we can run the sample in our 
debugger and see that it has unpacked the first DLL ("ykMTM…" see Fig.2 )



Fig. 2


We single step into the method where we hit the breakpoint and see in Fig. 3 that it has unpacked the next stage (coral).



Fig. 3


We analysed this stage and found that we can set another breakpoint in the qMayiwZxj class on line 113 (see Fig. 4) 



Fig. 4

This unpacks the next stage and we see the new unpacked stub.exe assembly (Fig. 5).



Fig. 5


If you have looked into other ConfuserEx obfuscated binaries, this looks
 familiar. Indeed, if you have a closer look, there is a well known 
friend, the gchandle.free() call on line 10082. This is our next 
breakpoint candidate. This call used to be the end of an unpacking stage
 in previous versions.



Fig. 6


As expected, this unpacks another module ConfuserEx is known for: koi. 



Fig. 7


We are getting closer, but the classes in koi are still empty and not yet filled with code:



Fig. 8


Again, we set a breakpoint on the last method called in koi's cctor and proceed running the sample.



Fig. 9

Nice, another DLL is unpacked, unfortunately it is nothing important. 
Our Main class and most others in stub are still empty. Single stepping,
 brings us back into <module>.  Once there, we  analysed the 
methods and found out that we can set another breakpoint at line 92 for 
unpacking the next stage (see Fig. 10). 



Fig. 10


Tada! If we now look in stub at the classes, they are filled with code. 
Now we can set a breakpoint on stub.Run() and start investigating what 
this malware loader is actually doing besides unpacking itself.



Fig. 11


We see that it is attempting to bypass some AV scans and reading several
 config parameters from the resource section. Below you can see the 
malware's configuration which was hidden encrypted in the resource 
section (Fig. 12) before unpacking.



Fig. 12

It checks if it was executed from the Startup folder (e.g. 
%AppData%\mozilla firefox\firefox ) as configured in the resource 
section. If not, it copies itself to the Startup folder and launches 
itself via cmd.exe. This means, we need to stop debugging and start 
again by loading the firefox.exe from %AppData%\mozilla firefox\firefox 
into dnSpy, following the unpacking again up to this point.



Fig. 13


Now we are in the "is executed from Startup location" branch. Here it 
gets interesting. First it makes itself persistent on the local machine.
 As you can see below, it writes a file called Update.txt with the 
following content to the %AppFolder%.

--- snip ---
C:\Users\dex\AppData\Roaming\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe
exit
--- snip ---


Fig. 14



Fig. 15


Then it adds this file to the auto-run registry key by executing reg add
 in a cmd.exe to make sure the firefox.exe file gets executed at PC 
start up:



Fig. 16a



Fig. 16b


It executes a couple of other methods based on the configuration and 
then loads and decompresses the LZMA compressed malware payload file 
(Recam) from the resources MainFile section. After a couple of runtime fixes it 
loads RunPEDLL.dll and tries to inject the file into the user's browser.
 In case this fails (e.g. no browser is running), it injects the file 
into itself (firefox.exe). In both cases the RunPE.Run() method is used 
to do that.



Fig. 17


From here on the work is done for the malware dropper and the loaded Recam binary takes over.


Payload
As mentioned in the introduction, the authors have gone the extra mile 
to frustrate analysis of the sample by using multiple obfuscation 
techniques, including multiple layers of data encryption, string 
obfuscation, piecewise nulling, and data buffer constructors. It also 
relies on its own C2 binary protocol. All relevant data is heavily 
encrypted before transmission.

The dropped binary is packed with vanilla UPX. This part is easy to 
unpack; the tricky part comes in the next stage. After the original 
Entry Point (OEP) is restored, it begins with some homebrew 
cryptographic initialization for several values that get used 
consistently throughout runtime. Most remain constant following the 
initialization routine, but some change over time. Some preliminary 
string deobfuscation occurs shortly thereafter and includes a single 
hard-coded Command and Control server (C2) IP.

mov     [esp+12Ch+var_12C], ebx
mov     [esp+12Ch+len], 8
mov     [esp+12Ch+ciphertext], offset mutex_name

This less frequently used deobfuscation routine is primarily based on a 
single-byte XOR loop. The other primary routine is JIT based and relies 
on a hard-coded decode key. Fortunately, IDA Pro's Appcall feature made short work of these obfuscations.



Fig. 18

Getting to the end of the preamble functions shortly following the PE 
Entry Point (EP), we get to an operation selection routine. The presence
 of unnecessary code and calculations disguises the fact that the jump 
to location 40849B will always be taken and the apparently interesting 
code that appears to involve file mangling and process creation is 
merely a decoy and always skipped in execution.

cmp     eax, [esp+1Ch+arg_0]
setz    al
add     esp, 1Ch
retn

Moving forward, the malware sets a Run key for system persistence. Near 
the end of the operations function, an additional thread is created to 
start up a keylogger component, logging to %APPDATA%\Logs with 
<DAY>-<MONTH>-<YEAR> as the file name format. Logged 
input is stored in the commonly seen bracket delimiters. However, as one
 might expect by now, the final data is encrypted before written to the 
file on disk.

Next, the malware will create an ID file entitled .Identifier. If such a
 file already exists in the PWD of the sample (extracted via the 
GetModuleFilename API), it is simply read in instead of created from 
scratch.



Fig. 19

Data to be written to the file is generated piece by piece and results in the following format:

(4 bytes)       Static ID
(13 bytes)      HostId-<6 character alphanumeric rand, seeded from system time>
(19 bytes)      19 null bytes
(19 bytes)      system time OR local time (19 byte format)
(13 bytes)      13 null bytes



Fig. 20

Note that since a static ID is used, the first 4 bytes of the file 
always remain the same (the cryptography used for the C2 data is much 
more complex).


Fig. 21



Fig. 22a



Fig. 22b

As with the .Identifier file, the initial C2 beacon will also always be 
68 bytes in length. Each C2 message (both client & server) will use 
the following format:

(4 bytes)       Length of data following these bytes
(1 byte)         C2 command
(n bytes)       Data relevant to the command

It's often easiest to break on a few instructions prior to deciphering 
the C2 beacon for many malware families these days. Whether it was 
intentional or not, the authors decided to opt of a homebrew crypto 
scheme allowing for randomized beacon data for each run (only the length
 bytes & C2 command for the beacon remain the same), or their 
homebrew crypto implementation is severely complex & broken.





Fig. 23



Fig. 24



Fig. 25

Once the beacon is sent, the sample waits for a server response. The C2 
we encountered is now down and resetting connections, but pcaps captured
 in sandbox environments at an earlier date can give us a better idea of
 what to expect for the rest of the communications. The following 
example shows the beacon, the initial response, one additional client 
transmission and a series of "keep alive" messages consisting of the 
sole command byte.



Fig. 26

At this point, code execution depends on a flow state that is set only a
 few times throughout the binary (initially set to 0xFFFFFFFF). As far 
as the response length and C2 command are concerned, this state further 
dictates which each attribute must be. For example, the function 
responsible for checking the response length checks the flow state too. 
If state has changed, it checks if the message length exceeds 0x30000. 
If it's still in the default state, it checks if the length is 0x41 
(length of the beacon message and its expected response). For the 
command byte itself, the default state checks if the command byte is set
 for the beacon phase of the communications (0x85). Once changed it will
 check to see if the command byte is less than or equal to 0xD2. 



Fig. 27








Fig. 28


The response and subsequent data (if any) are relayed to a large jump 
table that is responsible for checking the command byte and proceeding 
from there with a particular action as issued by the server.



Fig. 29


The beginning of the previously mentioned function and jump table checks
 flow state again to see if the relevant parameter now equals a 
previously set state outside of the 0xFFFFFFFF. If this is the case, the
 data from the last server response is decrypted with the same routine 
used by the sample to encrypt data before transit. When in the default 
state, the command byte is passed to a LEA (Load Effective Address) 
where a calculated address is stored in EAX. In this case, there will be
 no calculated address due to the zero-extended command byte being 
referenced by the instruction. Instead, 0x7F gets added to the command 
byte. The single byte stored in AL taken from the DWORD stored in EAX is
 compared against 0x51. If equal, it proceeds to the function end and 
returns with no further action taken. Otherwise, the final byte stored 
in AL is zero-extended to EAX itself, multiplied by 4 and passed to the 
jump to determine the next action as requested by the server.



Fig. 30

 As one might have gathered from the jump table, there are 82 possible 
commands that can be accepted from the server. However, not every 
command is unique. As we can see from the highlighted jump offsets 
below, many lead to the address shown earlier (RVA 0x227C) that is 
jumped to when completing no action.



Fig. 31

While time did not allow us to deeply examine each and every path, 
gathered sandbox pcaps along with our understanding of the command 
protocol allowed us to examine the commands sent by the server and 
calculate the jumps ourselves. Here are some examples of the 
functionality available in this variant of Recam, given the command.

0x85 (case 4) - Process initial server acknowledgement and set flow state
0x81 (case 0) - Keep-alive message
0xBD (case 12) - Download file to %TEMP% OR download file to %TEMP% and create new process
0x87 (case 6) - Create new process from argument
0x89 (case 8) - Close network socket, release mutex, call WSACleanup, & terminate process.

Conclusion
Malware is a moving target, it is constantly evolving in an arms race 
between the malware authors and the security researchers. This analysis 
shows the level of sophistication employed by threat actors in order to 
attempt to escape detection.

Obfuscation is an art form. Techniques can range from frequently changed
 packers to the multiple techniques employed in malware such as this. 
Often malware packers are modified by their authors very soon after 
deobfuscation tools or reports are publically released. In many cases it
 is enough for them to change minor parts of the obfuscator to confuse 
the deobfuscation tools.  Hence, malware researchers can't rely on these
 tools and must resort to be able to manually deobfuscate code when 
necessary. 

Understanding the steps that threat actors will go to to hide from 
detection and analysis is vital when it comes to protecting systems from
 malware. It is by applying lessons learnt from analyses such as this, 
that we are able to detect advanced malware with tools such as Advanced 
Malware Protection (AMP) and Threatgrid.
