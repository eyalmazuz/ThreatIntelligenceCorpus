Talos Wins The 5th Volatility Plugin Contest With Pyrebox





Talos has won this year's 5th Volatility plugin contest with Pyrebox. Volatility is a well-known open-source framework designed to analyze operating system memory. The framework has existed since 2007. For the previous 5 years they have run a plugin contest to find the most  innovative, interesting, and useful extensions for the Volatility framework. Pyrebox is an open-source Python scriptable Reverse Engineering sandbox developed by Talos. Based on QEMU, its goal is to aid reverse engineering by providing dynamic analysis and debugging capabilities from a different perspective. In this context, Pyrebox is able to interact with Volatility in order to collect information from the memory of the analysed system.
