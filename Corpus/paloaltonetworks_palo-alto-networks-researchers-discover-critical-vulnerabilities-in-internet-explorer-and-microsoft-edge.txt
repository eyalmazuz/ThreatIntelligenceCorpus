Palo Alto Networks Researchers Discover Critical Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge

Palo Alto Networks researchers Bo Qu and Hui Gao were credited with the discovery of three new critical Microsoft vulnerabilities affecting Internet Explorer (IE) versions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge. These vulnerabilities are covered in Microsoft’s December 2015 Security Bulletin and documented in Microsoft Security Bulletins MS15-125 and MS15-124. 
In our continuing commitment to the security research community, these vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft through our participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) program, which ensures the timely, responsible disclosure of new vulnerabilities and creation of protections from security vendors.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research and have discovered 80 critical Microsoft vulnerabilities over the past 18 months. By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers to compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
