Remove affected machine from 
network immediately 

Collect data from one machine 
at a time 

Track attackers and actively 
hunt for them in real-time 

Search for indicators of attack

Begin posturing for remediation 
on Day 1 of IR

Contain the adversary quickly

Long Long Ago 

Not So Long Ago

Today

Automation!

Search for indicators of compromise

Clean entire network before 
beginning to remediate

Conduct forensics for months before 
containment of the adversary

We need a shift in detection capabilities from indicators of compromise to

Indicators of Attack

Forces attackers to change behaviors

Not all behaviors change - good intel and pattern 
analysis can identify the new TTPs

Analysts need the ability to tailor intel
and extract relevance via tools and 
skillsets

Understanding your adversaries helps you gain 
focus and understand what intel is relevant

TTPs are now rapidly changing

Some things must still remain

What are adversaries adjusting to?

Better intelligence

Hiding from forensics

Better analysts

Better technology

How many adversaries are attacking you?

Successful spear-phish in

Jan 2015 

Complete set of tools for lateral 
movement copied to network and 
executed

Attackers identified as “living off 
the land” and largely using tools 
readily available on the system

Forensic analysis identifies 

lateral movement and malware 
created BEFORE spear-phish

Toolset attributed to China; use 
went back several years, but 
recently inactive

TTPs point to Russia; earliest 
activity occurred Jan 2015

Two attacker profiles emerge

Toolset #1: 
- Sloppy coding
- Compile time and debug info intact
- Chinese character set information present
Attribution: Eloquent Panda 

Toolset #2:
- Professional and sanitized code
- Use of valid digital signatures
- Attempts to frustrate reverse engineering

Multiple Adversaries?

Multiple Locations – Franchise Expansion

Different POS Software and Vendors

Different Support Vendors

Different Concerns on Security

Hunting and Responding

Understand the Environment

Do You Have Access to the Endpoint?

This is not a technical question ;-)

Do You Have Tools to Respond?

This is a technical question

Multiple Adversaries?

Plans to purchase

What adversaries would be interested?

Understand the negotiation plans

Hunting and Responding

Do you have access in multiple environments?

Law firm?

Other company?

Targeted hunting on people key to the M & A

…and their assistants

• Why would you care?

– Understand who is targeting your intellectual property

– Plan to spend your security budget better

– Employ more effective containment and mitigation strategies

• What areas of the kill chain is the adversary targeting?

• Where is the weakness?

• What  would better help you identify?

– Context of the incident

• M & A, Franchises, Development Plans

– Malware tools used

– Sequencing of commands

– Known C2 channels

• Why?

– Intellectual property leaving the building during the attack

– What makes you unique is quickly being taken

– Containment is not “Remediation”

• How?

– Visibility, Visibility, Visibility

– Isolate in real time

– New technologies allow for this

– Look at the IOAs

• Where in the attack cycle?

• When?

– As soon as possible

– Before forensics is complete? YES. Are you crazy? No.

THE TAKEAWAYS

Not every adversary group is created 
equal.  Groups have differing skills, 
resources, and capabilities.

Do not fit data into your expectations –
Look for anomalies in your findings 
focusing on timing, behavior, and 
tradecraft

The likelihood of being targeted by 
multiple adversaries is high.  In this 
example, remediation had to include both 
actors simultaneously!

• All Adversaries

– Privileged Account Control

• Think outside of the box on ways to do this

– Blacklisting known IOCs?

• What is the effort vs the reward?

– Service Accounts

• Can you reset them?

• Who has the source code?

• How long to fix it?

• Where is the adversary in the kill chain?

• The earlier in the kill chain, the more options at your disposal.

– Visibility, Visibility, Visibilty

– If you can find them at: exploitation, installation, command and control

• You can stop them quickly

– If you understand the pattern of the attack you have additional options

• Anticipate the next move

• Use the intel you collected
