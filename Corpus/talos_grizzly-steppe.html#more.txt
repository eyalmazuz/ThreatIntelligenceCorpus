Cisco Coverage for 'GRIZZLY STEPPE'


Over the past several weeks, there have been ongoing discussions regarding cyber attacks that have occurred against several political, governmental, and private sector entities in the United States.  These discussions have revolved around allegations that these cyber attacks were designed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Federal Elections as well as identifying who is responsible for these high-profile compromises.  On December 29, 2016, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a joint analysis report detailing some of the tools and infrastructure used by adversaries to compromise these institutions.  The DHS-FBI joint report is referring to this activity as GRIZZLY STEPPE.  Talos is aware of these discussions and reports of malicious activity associated with GRIZZLY STEPPE and has responded to ensure our customers are protected. 

Coverage for GRIZZLY STEPPE is available through Cisco's security products, services, and open source technologies.  The IP addresses listed in the DHS-FBI report have also been evaluated and applicable ones blacklisted.  Note that Talos will continue to monitor for new developments to ensure our customers remain protected.
