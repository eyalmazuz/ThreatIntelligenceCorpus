Microsoft Office Vulnerabilities Used to Distribute Zyklon Malware in Recent Campaign
January 17, 2018 | by Swapnil Patil, Yogesh Londhe
Introduction
FireEye researchers recently observed threat actors leveraging relatively new vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to spread Zyklon HTTP malware. Zyklon has been observed in the wild since early 2016 and provides myriad sophisticated capabilities.

Zyklon is a publicly available, full-featured backdoor capable of keylogging, password harvesting, downloading and executing additional plugins, conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and self-updating and self-removal. The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so. The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software. Zyklon also provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the spread and impact.

Infection Vector
We have observed this recent wave of Zyklon malware being delivered primarily through spam emails. The email typically arrives with an attached ZIP file containing a malicious DOC file (Figure 1 shows a sample lure).

The following industries have been the primary targets in this campaign:

Telecommunications
Insurance
Financial Services

Attack Flow
Spam email arrives in the victim’s mailbox as a ZIP attachment, which contains a malicious DOC file.
The document files exploit at least three known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, which we discuss in the Infection Techniques section. Upon execution in a vulnerable environment, the PowerShell based payload takes over.
The PowerShell script is responsible for downloading the final payload from C2 server to execute it.
A visual representation of the attack flow and execution chain can be seen in Figure 2.

Infection Techniques
CVE-2017-8759
This vulnerability was discovered by FireEye in September 2017, and it is a vulnerability we have observed being exploited in the wild.

The DOC file contains an embedded OLE Object that, upon execution, triggers the download of an additional DOC file from the stored URL (seen in Figure 3).

CVE-2017-11882
Similarly, we have also observed actors leveraging another recently discovered vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) in Microsoft Office. Upon opening the malicious DOC attachment, an additional download is triggered from a stored URL within an embedded OLE Object (seen in Figure 4).

The downloaded file, doc.doc, is XML-based and contains a PowerShell command (shown in Figure 6) that subsequently downloads the binary Pause.ps1.

Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is the interprocess communication mechanism that is exploited to perform remote code execution. With the help of a PowerShell script (shown in Figure 7), the next payload (Pause.ps1) is downloaded.


Figure 7: DDE technique used to download the Pause.ps1 payload

One of the unique approaches we have observed is the use of dot-less IP addresses (example: hxxp://258476380).

Figure 8 shows the network communication of the Pause.ps1 download.

Zyklon Delivery
In all these techniques, the same domain is used to download the next level payload (Pause.ps1), which is another PowerShell script that is Base64 encoded (as seen in Figure 8).

The Pause.ps1 script is responsible for resolving the APIs required for code injection. It also contains the injectable shellcode. The APIs contain VirtualAlloc(), memset(), and CreateThread(). Figure 9 shows the decoded Base64 code.

The injected code is responsible for downloading the final payload from the server (see Figure 10). The final stage payload is a PE executable compiled with .Net framework.

Once executed, the file performs the following activities:

Drops a copy of itself in %AppData%\svchost.exe\svchost.exe and drops an XML file, which contains configuration information for Task Scheduler (as shown in Figure 11).
Unpacks the code in memory via process hollowing. The MSIL file contains the packed core payload in its .Net resource section.
The unpacked code is Zyklon.

The Zyklon malware first retrieves the external IP address of the infected machine using the following:

api.ipify[.]org
ip.anysrc[.]net
myexternalip[.]com
whatsmyip[.]com
The Zyklon executable contains another encrypted file in its .Net resource section named tor. This file is decrypted and injected into an instance of InstallUtiil.exe, and functions as a Tor anonymizer.

Command & Control Communication
The C2 communication of Zyklon is proxied through the Tor network. The malware sends a POST request to the C2 server. The C2 server is appended by the gate.php, which is stored in file memory. The parameter passed to this request is getkey=y. In response to this request, the C2 server responds with a Base64-encoded RSA public key (seen in Figure 12).

After the connection is established with the C2 server, the malware can communicate with its control server using the commands shown in Table 1.

Plugin Manager
Zyklon downloads number of plugins from its C2 server. The plugin URL is stored in file in following format:

/plugin/index.php?plugin=<Plugin_Name>
The following plugins are found in the memory of the Zyklon malware:

/plugin/index.php?plugin=cuda
/plugin/index.php?plugin=minerd
/plugin/index.php?plugin=sgminer
/plugin/index.php?plugin=socks
/plugin/index.php?plugin=tor
/plugin/index.php?plugin=games
/plugin/index.php?plugin=software
/plugin/index.php?plugin=ftp
/plugin/index.php?plugin=email
/plugin/index.php?plugin=browser
The downloaded plugins are injected into: Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe.

Conclusion
Threat actors incorporating recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software – Microsoft Office, in this case – only increases the potential for successful infections. These types of threats show why it is very important to ensure that all software is fully updated. Additionally, all industries should be on alert, as it is highly likely that the threat actors will eventually move outside the scope of their current targeting.

At this time of writing, FireEye Multi Vector Execution (MVX) engine is able to recognize and block this threat. Table 2 lists the current detection and blocking capabilities by product.
