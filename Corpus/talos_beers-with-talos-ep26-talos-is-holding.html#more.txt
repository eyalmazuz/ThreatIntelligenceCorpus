EP26 Show Notes: 

Recorded 3/29/18 - Joel is sitting out this week, and Bill Largent from the Outreach team fills in. We are pretty sure he was just running late trying to live on Joel Mean Time which, coincidentally, is now a GitHub project thanks to Moses (link below).  We cover a wide range of topics in this episode, so stay with us! We chat about the Talos Threat Research Summit coming in June, we wonder where the carrots to match the sticks in security are, and weigh the value of finding your own damn vulns. The last part of the show starts with discussing GoScanSSH, which ends up being a discussion on the larger battle for the edge.
