EP28 Show Notes: 
Recorded April 27 - We have a special guest intro this week, since Mitch came down with a case of "can't speak above a whisper" during production of the episode. We chat about what defines an “APT” — is it the actor, the technical complexity used, or something different altogether? We also discuss the recent BGP attacks — how they work and how you can prepare for them — and the progress of GravityRAT.  Matt has specific feelings about USB-C and his new computer.
