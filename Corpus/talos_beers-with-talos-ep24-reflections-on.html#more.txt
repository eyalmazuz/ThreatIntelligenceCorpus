EP24 Show Notes: 


Recorded 3/2/18 - Craig is out this week, but the rest of the crew goes through COINHORDER and Memcached, and takes a deeper look at authentication and passwords.  We cover an overview of reflection attacks and how some password schemes that are meant to protect, actually cause harm.  We also bid you farewell, since our next episode is supposed to be live after the crew hosts a meeting that stands a not-insignificant chance of getting us all fired. Wish us luck — and send us questions that Craig can pose to really important Cisco executives.
