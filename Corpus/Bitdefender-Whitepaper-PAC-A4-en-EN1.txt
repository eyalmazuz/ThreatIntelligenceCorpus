White PaperOverview

Bitdefender detected and blocked an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign against Romanian institutions and 
other foreign targets. The attacks started in 2014, with the latest reported occurrences in May of 2016. The APT, 
dubbed Pacifier by Bitdefender researchers, makes use of malicious .doc documents and .zip files distributed 
via spear phishing e-mail.

Documents used range from curriculum vitae, to invitations to social functions or conferences, to second hand 
car offers and even, in one case, a letter of instructions from a high-ranking official. Some were marked as 
“urgent”, “important”, “immediate action required” and so on.

Other  samples  of  the  same  malicious  software  were  detected  in  Iran,  India,  Philippines,  Russia,  Lithuania, 
Thailand, Vietnam and Hungary. 

The high number of variants, in conjunction with the low number of reports and the nature of the affected 
machines has brought us to the conclusion that we are dealing with an APT.  

The malicious payloads delivered evolved over time, becoming stealthier and adding functionality as time went 
by. Our analysis focuses on three representative variants of the malware used in the attacks, but a number of 
others, differing by minor details, were found in the wild. 

Aside from the analysis, this paper lists hashes of malicious files, as well as other IOCs.

White Paper2014-15 Executable Files

The Infected Document

The infection starts from one infected document. 

Analysis  started  from  documents  containing  droppers.  The  dropper  is  encrypted  and  appended  to  the  end  of  the  document;  the 
document contains a script that reads, decrypts and runs the dropper. 

The last dword in the document file represents the size of the executable. The 5th byte from the end of the document is a checksum on 
the decrypted executable, used for validation. The actions from the script are summarized below:

size = last_dword_from_file; 
checksum = byte_before_size_dword; // read encrypted dropper in 
buffer for (key = 35, i = 0; i < size; i++)
{     buffer[i] = buffer[i] ^ key;
    key = (key ^ 217) ^ (i % 256); 
} for (sum = 0, i = 0; i < size; i++)
{     sum = sum ^ buffer[i]; 
}
if (sum ==checksum)(1 byte) 
{
    // write and execute the file in:
    // %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\MSWord.exe 
}

(4 bytes)

For the script to run, macros must be enabled in Word. 

As you can see in Appendix A the content of the infected documents is designed to trick the user 
into enabling the macros. If the macros are enabled the dropper is executed and opens another 
document, as expected by the user. For example if the infected document says it is a „protected” 
document and you must enable macros to view it, then the dropper will open another document 
with an invitation to a conference as the „protected” document. 

In Appendix B you can find some examples of these „pacifier” documents, these are clean and 
contain no scripts or executables.

White PaperThe Dropper

The script previously loaded from the infected .doc file executes the dropper from: 

%appdata%\Microsoft\Word\MSWord.exe

The dropper is a small executable that has the files to be deployed in the overlay encrypted with RC4. It just creates and runs the 
following files in this order:

- 

- 

- 

%appdata%\TMP\European_global_navigation_system.doc

%appdata%\Axpim\ubfic.exe

%appdata%\Axpim\ anfel.js

The file European_global_navigation_system.doc  is a clean document used to distract the user (see Appendix B). The file ubfic.exe 
is another dropper containing the real payload. The anfel.js file is used for self deletion. The names: Axpim, ubfic, anfel are random 
generated. 

The folder name will contain 4-6 characters and starts with capital letter. The file names contain 4-5 lowercase letters before the 
extension. The random generator is based on GetTickCount API. The algorithm for creating the names is presented below in python 
implementation. Practically, it concatenates random vowels and consonants, but with the condition that no more than two of the same 
type to be consecutive, with the aim of generating names that are somewhat pronounceable and thus may pass as man-made.

This algorithm was also used in some versions of Zeus for file name generation.

index = randint(0,1)          
 

# name length will be between minLen and maxLen
# flags - 4 name will contain spaces
#       - 2 name will have first letter uppercase
#       - can be combined 
def RandomName(minLen,maxLen,flag):
letters = [’aeiouy’, ’bcdfghklmnpqrstvwxz’]
name = ’ ’ seed()
index = randint(0,1)
nameLen = randint(minLen, maxLen)
for i in range(0, nameLen):
 if i > 0 and i % 2 == 0: 
 
 
            name = name + ’ ’
  
elif i % 2 == 0:
            name = name + choice(letters[index])
else:
            name = name + choice(letters[1 - index])
 if (flag & 2) == 2: 
name = name.title()
 return name.rstrip()   
# generate folder name
RandomName(4, 6, 2)
# generate file names
RandomName(4, 5, 0)

if (flag & 4) == 4 and len(name)>0 and name[-1]!=’ ’ and randint(0,3)==0:

White PaperThe Second Dropper

The payload dropper, ubfic.exe, contains its files in its .data section and is not encrypted or compressed. It creates the files:

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

%temp%\ntlm.exe

%temp%\msvci.dll

%temp%\msvcp.dll

%temp%\msvck.dll

%temp%\msvct.dll

%temp%\msvci.exe (64 bit)

%temp%\msvck60.dll (64 bit)

%temp%\msvct60.dll (64 bit)

These files make up the payload. The last three are for 64-bit Windows, the rest are for the 32-bit version. The starting point of the 
payload is the ntlm.exe file which is discussed below. Next, using COM objects, the dropper modifies the .lnk files from the desktop and 
saves the original links in %temp%\Links folder. The links are modified to start the trojan:

Lnk

Original 

Modified 

Target

„C:\Program Files\Sysinternals\Filemon.exe”
„C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\ntlm.exe” 
C:\Program Files\Sysinternals\Filemon.exe

The target file of the link is replaced with ntlm.exe and the original target is sent as a parameter to ntlm.exe, which upon execution 
will execute it. Next, the dropper creates %temp%\startup.bat which adds to the registry:

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchostUpdate -> %TEMP%\ntlm.exe

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Devices -> %TEMP%\ntlm.exe

The first key is for starting the trojan, along the .lnk files. Some versions do not have the lnk feature, only the registry keys. The 
second key is never used in our samples.

Last file created is %temp%\Axpim\selfdel.bat for self-deletion. 

msvcp.dll

32 bit library used for returning the PID of one of the processes: iexplore.exe, outlook.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe. It hase one export, 
msvcp, which enumerates running processes and checks their names. It will return the PID of the first one found. If the processes could 
not be enumerated it returns 0. If no process was found it returns -1. Instead of storing the actual names of those processes in the dll, 
it stores a byte array as a key and one byte array (result) for each of the 4 names. The checking is done: ProcessName xor key == result,  
on coresponding bytes. The function may return different PIDs when processes are stopped or started.

[7]

White Papermsvci.dll 

32 bit library used for injecting msvck.dll (the 32 bit backdoor) into a running 32 bit process. The library has one export msvci, which 
takes one parameter representing the PID of a running process. It allocates a small chunk of memory into that process (260 bytes). In 
this memory it copies the path to the msvck.dll file, which is found in %temp%\msvck.dll. 

Then, from the current process it gets the address of LoadLibraryA function and creates a remote thread in the target process starting 
at that address. The parameter sent for the thread function is the address of the new allocated string containing the path to msvck.dll. 
As a result, in the target process, a thread is created which just executes LoadLibraryA(„path to msvck.dll”). 

This method will work even if ASLR is enabled, because the random loading offset for dlls is calculated once per boot and by default 
one dll is loaded at the same address in different processes. msvci.exe

64 bit application used for injecting msvck60.dll (the 64 bit backdoor) into a running 64bit process. The executable takes a commandline 
parameter representing a PID. The functionality is identical to msvci.dll library. ntlm.exe

This is the file that starts the trojan. First, it creates a named pipe \\.\pipe\bc367  used as a mutex, as the file will probably be executed 
many times from the shortcuts. The name of the pipe and all other strings in the file and in the rest of the dlls are encrypted with RC4. 
It sets the other files of the trojan (msvci.dll, msvcp.dll, msvck.dll, msvct.dll, msvci.exe, msvck60.dll, msvct60.dll) as hidden, ntml.exe 
will not be hidden. 

Afterwards, the executable enters an infinite loop.

It checks if the file %temp%\msvci.dll exists, if it does not exist it will do a self destroy: deletes all components, deletes registry keys, 
restores the original lnk files from %temp%\Links, closes the pipe. This behaviour is used by the backdoor component later for self 
deleting. 

Next it loads the msvcp.dll library and call msvcp export from it. This function returns the PID of one of the processes: iexplore.exe, 
outlook. exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe, and 0 or -1 if none of those processes was found. If a process was found, its PID is saved into a 
variable, then the program checks whether that process is a 32 bit or 64 bit process. 

If it is a 32 bit process it calls msvci export from msvci.dll with one parameter, the PID. If the process is a 64 bit process it creates a

The purpose of msvci.dll and msvci.exe (64bit) is to inject the payload into a process.  After this it sleeps 30 seconds and repeats 
indefinitely. 

The saved PID is checked so that it doesn’t inject again into the same process. This mecanism is flawed because another process from 
the list could be found and it will inject into it also, or it is possible to inject in the same process twice, for example outlook.exe opened 
first and injected then iexplore.exe opened second and injected then iexplore.exe closed and outlook.exe injected again. 

Another bug can appear if msvcp.dll will be deleted because when calling LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress it doesn’t check the return 
values and the program will crash when calling a NULL pointer. 

msvct.dll

32 bit library contains functions for communicating with the C&C, using WinINet API. The backdoor does  not contain any C&C 
addresses or networking logic, it just uses the exports from msvct.dll, namely: 

BOOL CI(void) – Checks for internet connection. Returns true if a http request („GET /1”) to  www.google.com succeeds; 

-  
returns false if not.

BOOL SHR(char *ServerAddr, char *ServerScript, void *ID, void *SendBuff, void *RecvBuff,  void *extra) – Sends and receives 

- 
data to/ from C&C. The communication is encrypted through HTTPS, port 443. 

- 
Extra flags are used for the connection: INTERNET_FLAG_IGNORE_ CERT_DATE_INVALID,  INTERNET_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_
CN_INVALID, SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA to ignore errors caused by invalid certificates. ServerAddr and ServerScript 
make the address of the C&C, these are found using the CS export. ID is a structure made from a buffer (string) and its length. The ID 
string will be put into the HTTP headers.  SendBuff is the same type of structure like the ID. SendBuff contains data that is sent to the 
C&C. RecvBuff is a structure that contains 4 members, 3 being pointers: a data buffer, a buffer length and two strings. This structure 
will be filled with data coming from C&C. The data buffer can contain batch commands or whole files to be written to disk. The first 
string will contain the Content-Type from the headers and this will be the command for the backdoor. The second string will contain the 
Content-Location from the headers and will have the name of a file for download/upload commands. The last parameter, extra, is again 
a structure from a buffer and its length. It is optional. The string that it contains is sent through the HTTP header. This is used by the 
CS export and then it contains that „Check: RandomNr” string for C&C validation. It is also used in the „upload” backdoor command. 
The function returns true or false.

- 
BOOL CS(void *ID, char *ServerAddr, char *ServerScript) – Check C&C connectivity. Returns true if it founds a valid C&C and 
ServerAdd, ServerScript (output parameters) will contain the address and the page/script of the C&C. ID (input parameter) is a structure 
that contains a string and its length. The string represents an ID identifying the infected system. This function tries two hardcoded C&C 
addresses: 88.208.0.130/rss.php, 78.47.51.238/rss.php (other variants used different addreses). It generates a random number from 0 
to 32767 and then creates a string with it, such as: „Check: 1352”. This string will be sent in the http headers using SHR function to the 
C&C. If a C&C is alive it must respond with the string „1352” back. If none of the two C&Cs are alive the function returns false.

msvct60.dll

64 bit version of msvct.dll msvck.dll
32 bit library containing the main functionality, the actual backdoor. It has no exports and will only execute if injected into iexplore.exe, 
outlook.exe, firefox.exe or chrome.exe. 
First, it checks the internet connection using the CI export from msvct.dll. If it has no internet access the execution ends. 

Next it creates an ID of the infected system as a string such as: 
„MyCookie: {eceee5c0-1eca-11de-abc9-806d6172696f}{3559831177}” – the GUID is obtained using GetCurrentHwProfile API and the 
second bracketed number is the volume serial number. If GetCurrentHwProfile fails the ID will be:

„MyCookie: UserName{3559831177}” – with the username from GetUserNameA API and again the volume serial number.

[9]

White PaperThe ID created will be used to check the connection to the C&C with the CS export from msvct.dll. The connection is checked in an 
infinite loop with a sleep of 28 minutes after each check, until a valid, active C&C server is found. The C&C addresses are contained 
in msvct.dll and one of them is returned by CS function on success. It can be seen that the loop was meant to only check 3 times for 
the connection (like other samples do), but, maybe because this is a intermediary version or by negligence, the code actually loops 
indefinitely. 

After  this  follows  the  code  for  a  regular  backdoor  which  receives  commands  from  the  C&C.  The  commands  are  received  and  the 
results are sent back with the SHR export from msvct.dll. The backdoor will be identifying the computer with the ID it created. After 
3 successful commands received it will sleep for 28 minutes. After 3 consecutive failed commands (SHR returns false) it will again 
perform a C&C validation with the CS function in an infinite loop. Here it may receive the other C&C address. If a command is received 
but it is not recognized it will sleep again for 28 minutes. The commands are text strings and are described below:

„cmd” - Creates the file %temp%\xmlupd.bat which will contain batch commands. It creates a process with xmlupd.bat but with stderr 
and stdout redirected to the file %temp%\1. It waits maximum 30 seconds for it to finish then it will kill the process. After that it sends 
back to the C&C the content of the %temp%\1 file. Some examples of commands received:
systeminfo
set
netstat –ano
dir/a %programfiles%   
dir /a %programfiles(x86)%
„download” – Receives a file and writes it to %temp%. The name of the file is also received from C&C. It will not execute the file.

„upload” – Receives a file name, reads the file, converts the content to base64 and sends it to the C&C with an extra HTTP header „File: 
filename”. If it doesn’t find the file it sends back the last error (GetLastError for CreateFileA). 

 „text/html” – This looks like a normal Content-Type HTTP header value (the commands arrive in the Content-Type header). When this 
is received it resets the number of consecutive failed commands and sleeps 28 minutes. The backdoor will continue after.

„close” – Stops the execution of the backdoor, the injected thread will terminate.

„selfdestroy” – Deletes the file %temp%\msvci.dll then ntlm.exe will take care of deleteing all other components. The backdoor ends 
execution after the command.

msvck60.dll

64 bit version of msvck.dll.

White Paper2014-15 Browser Extension

The Infected Document 
The  infection  start  from  a  document  cv_Mate.Dimitrescu.doc  .  The  document  is  constructed  in  the  same  way  as  the  documents 
containing the other variant of the malware. The script in it has the same functionality, it will create and execute the dropper %appdata%\
Microsoft\Word\MSWord.exe

The Dropper
The dropper looks the same as the other droppers, only smaller in size. The files that it contains are encrypted with RC4 in overlay. Only 
two files will be dropped:

%appdata%\Aggea\ivotp.xpi

%appdata%\Aggea\ylir.js

The names Aggea, ivotp.xpi, ylir.js are random generated. No clean document is present in the dropper and the initial infected document 
will not close. There is no second dropper either. The javascript file is executed, installs the xpi file as an extension in Firefox and then 
deletes the directory %appdata%\Aggea\.

The Firefox Extension
The extension file will be renamed to {285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad}.xpi then will be installed in Firefox. In the browser it 
will appear with the name „langpack-en-GB 15.0.0” as in the picture below.

[11]

White PaperWe tested it in Firefox 35.0, in some newer versions it didn’t work. In this version of the malware the extension will work as the backdoor. 
The functionality is contained in 3 files in the extension package: 1.js, 2.js, main.js. 

1.js

The file 1.js contains encryption and decryption routines. Algorithm used is AES, and the implementation seems to be copied from 
https:// github.com/chrisveness/crypto/blob/master/aes.js  and ran through an obfuscator.

2.js

The file 2.js contains the C&C addresses and the network functionality. All data to and from the C&C will be sent through normal 
HTTP but it will be encrypted and converted to base64. The encryption key is generated once when the extension is started but it 
can be changed if the C&C requests as we will see later. In this variant we find 6 C&C addresses (presumably these are previously-
compromised machines):

http://reckless.dk/wp-includes/class-pomo.php 
http://reckless.dk/wp-includes/class.wp-db.php 
http://fishstalk.esy.es/wp-content/plugins/bbpress/includes/common/menu.php 
http://fishstalk.esy.es/wp-includes/SimplePie/Net/IPv4.php 
http://77-ufo.com/wp-includes/class-menu.php 
http://77-ufo.com/pma/db_table.php

The strings in the files are not visible because the javascript files are highly obfuscated. The function that sends the data to the C&C 
also receives the response. The function will select each time a C&C that responds from the list. This file would be the equivalent of 
the msvct. dll file from the earlier version.

main.js

The file main.js is the actual backdoor (msvck.dll equivalent). The malware starts by creating an ID for the system. The ID is a Md5 hash 
on some data colected from the system. The ID is sent in every request to the C&C as in the previous version with executable files. This 
is an example of the data collected for the ID from a test machine:

{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad}C:\Documents  and  
Settings\user\Application  Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2gmaw237. defaultC:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop{ec8030f7-
c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}

There are no line separators, it is just a long string. The ID in this case will be „5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807”. The gathered 
data represents:

{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad} – GUID for the extension

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2gmaw237.default

Firefox profile folder where the extension was placed

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop – desktop folder of the active user
[12]

White Paper{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384} - GUID for Firefox

After    the    ID    was    generated,    an    encryption/decryption    key    will    be    created.    It    concatenates    the    hardcoded    string 
„7201895b632dc5044c02ea98b0dbd371”  with  the  string  containing  the  ID.  In  the  case  of  our  example  this  will  make  the  string 
“7201895b632dc5044c02ea98b0dbd3715815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807”. Then it makes the Md5 hash on the string which will 
result in “ec398e010a0cb6b6e4f48722dc07eaa3”. 

This  final  buffer  (containing  a  C  like  string  with  the  md5)  is  the  decryption  key.  The  key  is  subsequently  used  for  encryption  and 
decryption of every message sent and received from the C&C. 

Next it gathers more data about the system. Again, an example from the test machine:

5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807 {285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad} winnt x86

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop

0040|||C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2gmaw237.default\user.js

Lines are separated by line feed (0x0A). The data represents:

5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807 – System ID

{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad} – GUID for the extension winnt x86 – Operating system

C:\Perl... - %path%

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2gmaw237.default – Path to Firefox profile

C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop – Desktop folder of the logged user

C:\Documents and Settings\user\ApplicationData\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2gmaw237.default\user.js – Config file for Firefox which 
can override normal settings, it will try to delete it. If is still present after deletion it will put 0041 instead 0040 as the status. 

The data is encrypted with the key that was generated and sent to the C&C. Finally the malware sets a timer which calls a function 
that sends to C&C, receives from C&C and processes the backdoor commands every five seconds. The commands are made up from 3 
strings separated by „|||”,like „nr|||string1|||string2”. 

nr will be ‚0’ to ‚6’ and represents the backdoor command. string1 and string2 contain file names, urls and other things used by the 
commands. In some commands string2 is not used. The commands are:

[13]

White Paper„1|||file commandlineOptions” 

Executes the file „file” with command line parameters „commandlineOptions”. stdout and stderr are redirected to a string and the 
content of the string will be sent to the C&C. If the file to be executed does not exists it sends back to the C&C „0011|||file”

„2|||url|||file”

Downloads the file from „url” and writes it with the name „file”. Returns to the C&C „0020|||file” if the file was successfuly written, 
„0021|||file” if the file was not written or „0051|||url|||errCode” if the download failed.

„3|||file”

Searches the file „file” and sends it to the C&C. In case of an error it will return „0034|||file” if the file is a folder, „0033|||file|||size” if the 
file size is greater than 5000000 bytes, „0031|||file” if the file exists but it couldn’t get information about it, „0032|||file” if the file does 
not exists, „0051|||url|||errCode” if the file could not be sent due to some network problems.

„4|||file”

Deletes the file „file”. Returns to the C&C „0040|||file” if the file was deleted or „0041|||file” if the file could not be deleted.

„5|||string1|||file”

Sends back „string1” to the C&C. The C&C responds with a buffer which will be written to the file „file”. It sends back to the C&C 
„0020|||file” if the file was successfuly written, „0021|||file” if the file could not be written or „0051|||url|||errCode” in case of network 
problems.

„6|||path|||depth”

Lists files and directories from „path” recursively until „depth” level, then it sends the list to the C&C. An example:

          0060|||c:\0
           1|c:\0\Documents|d|ct=NaN|lat=1442919637000|lmt=1442919637000|
           1|c:\0\main.js|17394|ct=NaN|lat=1442919639000|lmt=1442405697000|
           1|c:\0\main1.js.js_format|9486|ct=NaN|lat=1442919639000|lmt=1442404160000|
2|c:\0\Documents\rec.doc|12|ct=NaN|lat=1442919637000|lmt=1442919637000|
           ...
           0061|||path_failed|||error_code 
           ...
           0061|||c:\0|||10000
The „path” listed  and a return code would be „0060|||c:\0”. „1” and „2” from the start of the lines is the level of a file or directory. The 
count starts at 1 and the maximum level would be „depth”+1This is followed by a file or directory path. After the path a „d” follows, if the 
path specifies a directory, or something like „17394” in case of a file, which is the size of the file. „ct=NaN” is the creation time of a file. 
There is a typo in the code and because of that the creation time is never actually retrieved („winBirtdhDate” instead of „winBirthDate”). 
„lat=1442919637000” is the last access time. „lmt=1442919637000” is  last modified time. „0061|||path_failed|||error_code” is optional 
and may appear multiple times, contains a path at which the file enumeration failed. „00061|||c:\0|||10000” at the end is optional and 
appears only if the listing so far contains more than 10000 characters, then no more lines will be added.

„0|||key”

Sets a new encryption/decryption key with the C string „key”

White PaperOther 2015 variants

We found different versions of the files with almost identical functionality and only minor differences. The most notable difference is 
that C&C addresses vary. Another interesting fact is where the samples were spotted.

Documents
The documents differ in what they present but they are identical in where the dropper resides and how the script operates.

Droppers
The most common level 1 droppers contain the files encrypted with RC4 in the overlay and level 2 droppers have the files in clear in 
.data section. Some level 1 and level 2 droppers are just selfextracting winrar archives, but they have the same functionality. 
Firefox addon
Only one version was found.

ntlm.exe, svchost.exe, dwms.exe
Different names for the starting executable. Some variants do not have the link files functionality and rely only on the registry key to 
start. All variants use the key HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and the value is named „svchostUpdate” or 
„dwm service”.

msvci.dll
Some versions check if the process into which they inject is 64 bit or 32 bit. If it is 64 bit „msvci.exe PID” is executed. This looks like 
an early version of the code because the functionality for 32/64 bit is in ntlm.exe file and if we have a 64 bit process to inject, msvci.dll 
would not be loaded in the first place.

msvct.dll
Different C&C addresses.

msvck.dll
Some versions check the C&C in an infinite loop other will check it only 3 times and if no connection could be established the execution 
ends. The computer ID has a GUID obtained with GetCurrentHwProfile in some versions and in others the GUID is taken from the 
registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\ MachineGuid

Strings
Almost all strings in the files are encrypted. They are encrypted with RC4 in all versions, only the decryption keys are different.

White Paper2016 attack wave

 
In May 2016 we have encountered a new wave of attacks. They came, at least in some known cases, as spear phishing emails containing 
various documents: topics like Oil conferences, international politics, budget calculations, simple guidelines on how to interview for a 
job in foreign affairs. 

The attackers moved away from using documents containing macro scripts to employing a zip archive containing a java-script file 
that would in turn drop a clean document and the actual malware. The archived file has a double extension, something like urgent-
document.doc.js. This method is probably more efficient, as the victim doesn’t have to enable macros in Word Viewer.

Generally speaking, the components are slightly different from the 2015 variants but they achieve the same results. As a general 
rule, we observed that these variants tend to be stealthier than past years’ variants because malware is only injected in legitimate 
processes, so that no new main executable will be seen in the process list after injection. The components are outlined below.

Document containing malicious macro script

The new infected documents have a different structure, as seen in the picture. The clean document is 
encrypted directly in the infected document, not contained in the dropper as with previous versions. The 
macro from the infected document will decrypt and run the clean document and the dropper. 

At the end of the document there is a dword which contains the total size (document+dropper+4). In front 
of the encrypted document is a dword which represents its size. After the encrypted document there is one 
byte, the checksum. 

The encrypted dropper has the same structure. The checksum algorithm remains the same but the 
encryption is slightly different than before:

// decrypt

for (key = 75, i = 0; i < size; i++)

{

    buffer[i] = buffer[i] ^ key;

    key = (key ^ ((200 + i) % 256) ^ (i % 256); 
}

The Dropper

The droppers are self-extracting Winrar archives. They do not contain the clean document any more. The 
component files are extracted to:

-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\dws.exe
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msi.dll
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msi32.dll
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msk.dll  (optional)
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msp.dll
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\mst.dll

[16]

White Paper-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msi.exe  (64 bit)
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msi60.dll  (64 bit)
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msk60.dll  (64 bit, optional)
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msp60.dll  (64 bit)
-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\mst60.dll  (64 bit)

-  %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\msvci60.dll  (64 bit)

msk.dll and msk60.dll are not always present in which case their functionality is taken by another dll. After the files are dropped the 
file dws.exe is executed without any parameters.

msp.dll

Similar to the old msvcp.dll. Returns the PID of some processes. It has 3 important exports: p, p1, p2. 

• p export has the functionality as the older variant, returns the PID of one of iexplore.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe, outlook.exe. 

• p1 export returns the PID of dwm.exe (Windows Desktop Manager). 

• p2 returns the PID of taskhostex.exe (Host Process for Windows Tasks) or sihost.exe (Shell Infrastructure Host). These are 
legitimate processes that can be found in Windows 8 and Windows 10. Some variants do not search for sihost.exe. 

• Some variants also have another export kp which kills a process, but it’s never invoked.

msp60.dll

64 bit variant of msp.dll.

msi.dll

This is similar to the old msvci.dll. It has one export msvci with two parameters, a path to a file and a PID. It will inject the file from the 
path into the process with that PID. For 32 bit processes.

msvci60.dll

64 bit variant of msi.dll.

msi.exe

Similar to msi.dll, for 64 bit processes. It will look for 1 or 2 command line parameters. 
The first is a process PID. The second parameter can be anything and is just a flag for 
knowing what library to inject: 2 parameters – will inject msi60.dll, 1 parameter – will 
inject msk60.dll. The injection is done with the msvci export from msvci60.dll.

dws.exe

The starting module. If it was started with a parameter and the parameter is not a number (as an ascii string), it will create a process 
with the executable taken from the parameter; this looks like a reminiscent of the .lnk files functionality. 

If the parameter is a number, the number will be interpreted as a PID and it will check if the process with that PID is a 32/64 bit 
process. If it is a 64 bit process, dws.exe will create a new process with the command line “msi.exe PID”. If it is a 32 bit process, dws.
exe will load msi.dll and call its export as msvci(“msvck”,pid). In this case (parameter as number received) the execution stops here. 

If the file msp.dll is not present it will delete all components of the trojan. Otherwise it will call from msp.dll the export p1 or p2 (only 
on Windows 8/10 or Server 2012) to get the PID of dwm.exe, taskhostex.exe or sihost.exe. If the returned PID is for a 64 bit process 

[17]

White Paperwill run “msi.exe PID 1”; two parameters are passed, the last one being dummy and used by msi.exe just to know to take a different 
path of execution. If the returned PID is for a 32 bit process, it will load msi.dll and call msvci(“msi32.dll”, PID). After this the program 
terminates (the older ntlm.exe would have stayed in a loop here).

msi32.dll

Code from this library will execute injected in dwm.exe, taskhostex.exe. Sets the same registry autorun key as the 2015 variants. It 
will also set a scheduled task:

schtasks /create /SC DAILY /ST 12:00 /TN update /F /TR %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11\dws.exe

which will make sure that main module will start daily.

Checks if msp.dll exists, if it does not, it will execute dws.exe without parameters, which in turn will self delete the Trojan. It uses 
from msp.dll the p export to get a PID. If that PID is a 32 bit process it will run “dws.exe PID” and if it is a 64 bit process it will run 
“msi.exe PID”. Those processes with parameters will inject the actual backdoor (msk.dll). It will stay in a loop and try to find targeted 
processes in order to inject in them. This variant of the Trojan is stealthier than the previous one in which ntlm.exe would stay in a 
loop and try to inject, in which case a suspicious process (ntlm.exe) would be visible.

msi32.dll – with backdoor functionality

In some droppers msi32.dll has another variant different enough to be described separately. In this case msi32.dll would contain 
backdoor functionality along the functionality described earlier. It will function in 2 ways (backdoor or earlier msi32.dll) based on the 
name of the process from which it runs. If the containing process is dwm.exe, taskhostex.exe or sihost.exe it will function like the 
usual msi32.dll and also will copy itself as msk.dll for later use as the backdoor. If the containing process is another process then it 
will function as the backdoor (identical to msk.dll). 

msi60.dll

64 bit variant of msi32.dll.

msk.dll

The backdoor component, similar to the old msvck.dll, it has the same functionality. For selfdelete it will delete msp.dll. It also has a 
new backdoor command “st” which sets the time in milliseconds for Sleep, time value received from the C&C. 

msk60.dll

64 bit variant of msk.dll.

mst.dll

Library used for communication with the C&C. Very similar to the old msvct.dll. Internet connection is checked with “go.microsoft.
com” .

mst60.dll

64 bit variant of mst.dll.

White PaperFunctionality diagram

Functionality summary:

1.  The macro from the infected document will drop and open a dummy clean document and a dropper.

2.  The dropper will drop the component files in the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11\ and will open dws.exe without 

parameters.

3.  dws.exe will use the function p2 (only on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012) or the function p1 from msp.dll. p1 will return the 

PID of dwm.exe, p2 will return the PID of taskhostex.exe.

[19]

White Paper4.  dws.exe will load msi.dll and will call its export as msvci(“msi32.dll”, PID), with the PID returned from step 3. This will inject msi32.

dll into dwm.exe or taskhostex.exe depending on the OS. After this dws.exe process terminates.

5.  a.   msi32.dll will add a run key in registry and a scheduled task, both will open dws.exe 

b.   msi32.dll will copy itself to msk.dll. This step is done only in some versions where msi32.dll has the backdoor functionality and 

the initial backdoor msk.dll is missing.

6.  msi32.dll will use the function p from msp.dll which will return the PID of one of iexplore.exe, outlook.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe.

7.  msi32.dll will create a new process with dws.exe with a parameter, the PID returned at step 6. If at step 6. the file msp.dll was not 

found (selfdelete from backdoor), it will create a new process with dws.exe but without parameters, which in turn will delete all 

components. msi32.dll will stay in a loop repeating from step 6 (the backdoor variant of msi32.dll will exit).

8.  dws.exe  with  a  parameter  will  function  differently  and  will  call  the  export  from  msi.dll  as  msvci(“msk.dll”,  PID),  with  the  PID 

returned at step 6., received as a command line parameter. This will inject msk.dll in the specified process. After this dws.exe 

process terminates. At this step it does not matter if msk.dll is the msi32.dll variant or not.

9.  msk.dll is the backdoor program and will use exports from mst.dll to communicate with the C&C. In case that msk.dll is msi32.

dll variant the selfdelete will be done here (start dws.exe) and not in step 7. because msi32.dll will no longer run in dwm.exe, 

taskhostex.exe or sihost.exe.

Zip file containing malicious java-script

In this variant victim is lured to double click on a file with double extension .doc.js  this way java-script file gets executed, will 

decode a clean Word document and a malware executable file, both are embedded in java-script. Next, a windows task is created 

to run the malware, and clean document is opened. Malware execution follows as previously described.

C&C

 

We have 4 unique C&Cs for 2016 variants, hosted in Netherlands, New York and Germany. The machines used are most 

likely compromised web servers.
