Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes 
Remote Access Trojan Efficacy By Levi Gundert

Executive’s Business Case 

Continuously incorporating known remote access trojan (RAT) controller locations into operational defense workflow and 
detection technologies is useful, and automating correlation with internal telemetry will identify potential infections, but the 
deeper value to the business, that reduces risk,  is to understand the adversary behind each RAT instance.

Adversary attribution is difficult, but worthwhile, since motivation informs methodology. Exploring an attacker’s capabilities 
and infrastructure becomes an ancillary benefit. One of the best ways to achieve consistent attribution results is to develop 
original attribution methodologies. An example of one such methodology – proactive Internet services enumeration – and 
the applied results for Trojans like njRAT and Dark Comet are detailed in this report.

Background

A remote access trojan (RAT)1 is a feature-rich controller/server software suite that facilitates surreptitious (as its name 
suggests) and unauthorized access to a victim’s computer. RATs are generally leveraged by adversaries with malicious 
intent to record local victim audio, video, keystrokes (in addition to exfiltrating files), and more2.

The full spectrum of threat actors – especially criminals and nation-state agents – continue to leverage commodity RATs 
even  after  the  original  author  has  been  apprehended3.  Nation-state  campaigns  have  routinely  included  payloads  like 
Poison Ivy4 and close derivatives because they are easy to configure, highly re-usable, and the RAT remains an effective tool 
against anti-virus software. This is especially true of dictatorial regimes that use RATs to hunt for the identity and location 
of political dissidents5 within their own borders.

Criminals use RATs because the technical barriers to entry are low and the knowledge required to effectively operate a 
RAT can be quickly acquired from free Internet tutorials6 which feature content such as packing/crypting7 a RAT to evade 
anti-virus software; demonstrating capabilities with multiple victims8; and establishing infrastructure9, like dynamic DNS 
(DDNS)10, to support a long-term operation.

  malicious purpose

Recorded Future Threat ResearchIn a bit of a reversal from traditional botnet nomenclature, a commodity RAT file (executable) is typically labeled as the 
“server” when it is installed on a victim host (through any number of “spreading” mechanisms), and the client (control panel) 
“or controller” resides on the RAT operator’s computer.

Historically, the security community has generally relied upon passive malware collection methodologies to identify RAT 
families  and  campaigns.  Sources  include  customer  telemetry,  honeypots,  and  malware  processing  and  aggregation 
services like VirusTotal. While these are useful resources, using them makes it is difficult to quickly and proactively identify 
all live instances of a particular RAT campaign. Additionally, the derivative insight that businesses rely on is largely reactive 
and only as good as the sources collecting the malware.

Today, threat intelligence teams continue to depend on the bulk processing of malware samples for derivative indicators of 
compromise (IOCs) that support new rules in defensive technologies. This approach, while partially effective, relies on large 
amounts of computing and Internet resources to process the tens (to hundreds) of thousands of daily malware samples 
collected by security vendors. The problem is that even anti-virus companies encounter challenges processing the vast 
amount of daily samples.

The solution is proactive and iterative large scale Internet enumeration (scanning), which allows businesses  to identify 
hosts matching specific RAT signatures, and those hosts may  lead to quick and direct operator attribution.

This scanning approach reveals a high number of RAT operator locations that were previously unknown to primary malware 
resources – VirusTotal and #totalhash. Additionally, many of the RAT controllers are located on residential ISP (Internet 
Service Provider) subnets, potentially indicating the RAT operator’s physical location.

Originating Intelligence

Internet scanning was largely impractical when Nmap11 was the only available off-the-shelf option (short of writing a custom 
asynchronous multithreading scanner). The release of Unicorn Scan12, and more recent releases of Zmap13, and MASSCAN14 
respectively, enabled the enumeration of the full IPv4 address space in a relatively short amount of time – minutes – from 
a single connected device. In addition to open port discovery, these tools return daemon banner information that is highly 
useful for identifying RAT controllers. Port scanning tools are often used to identify and count specific services available to 
the public Internet, and using these same tools to identify and profile RATs is advantageous both for law enforcement and 
operational defenders.

RATs return specific responses (strings) when a proper request is presented on the RAT controller’s listener port. Specific 
signatures are withheld in this report to avoid adding a chapter to the threat actor playbook, but it is a straightforward 
process to profile a RAT family. In some cases, even a basic TCP three-way handshake15 is sufficient to elicit a RAT controller 
response. The unique response is a fingerprint indicating that a RAT controller (control panel) is running on the computer 
in question. Therefore RAT controllers and their operators are inherently vulnerable because they are often operating 
openly on the Internet and they generate unique response strings when properly interrogated.

To  profile  a  specific  RAT  family,  samples  and/or  full  packet  captures  (PCAP)  must  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  there  
are  numerous  security  researchers  that  publicly  and  generously  share  malicious  code  (malware)  generated  network  
packet captures16.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchAnalysis of RAT controller responses within these packet captures leads to digital fingerprints that can be subsequently 
used in tandem with an Internet scanner to identify live instances of RAT controllers, and in some cases the RAT operator’s 
home IP address and approximate geographic location. 

For example, one version of a ubiquitous RAT returns a “0” subsequent to an HTTP GET method.

Enumeration of a /20 subnet in Palestine with MASSCAN reveals a signature match with a specific host on port 1177.

Similarly,  a  scan  of  a  /16  residential  subnet  in  Algeria  reveals  multiple  hosts  listening  on  port  1177,  but  only  one  – 
197.205.47.239 – that matches the above signature. 

Positive matches can be further confirmed via Curl17 or Python Scapy18 to identify potential false positives.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchPotentially there are additional legitimate daemons that may also return a “0,” thus complete certainty about a positive RAT 
verdict in this case is absent. Rather, this is one example of RAT profiling with a fairly unique RAT controller response string.

Another example is Havex RAT19. Netresec produced an informative blog in 201420 dissecting Havex’s communication 
pattern. Noticeably, the Havex response includes the string “havex.” 

Scaling the Methodology

Shodan21, the search engine for Internet services, created and currently maintained by John Matherly - is incorporated to 
scale RAT identification efforts. Shodan contains multiple benefits when compared to traditional scanning tools, including 
un-attributable  tasking,  continuous  scanning  without  building  and  maintaining  infrastructure,  and  Shodan  contains 
hundreds of additional signatures for popular ports and services. Shodan’s Web application and command line interface 
(CLI) are both easy to use, and Shodan results include all available port information for any given host.

Shodan’s signatures also include RATs, specifically Black Shades, Dark Comet, njRAT, XtremeRAT, Poison Ivy, and Net Bus. 
Thus Shodan is a valuable and useful originating intelligence source for identifying live RAT controllers. While the number 
of results varies, Shodan typically identifies between 400 and 600 individual RAT controllers on any given day. The results 
from September 18, 2015, can be downloaded from Recorded Future’s GitHub page.

A  week’s  worth  of  consolidated  and  unique  RAT  controller  IP  addresses  from  early  July  2015  totaled  633.  The  week 
following, VirusTotal returned derivative malware results for 153 of the 633 IP addresses or a 24% positive correlation 
rate22. Consequently, this originating methodology applied with Shodan identifies RAT controller instances often before the 
malware sample is submitted to VirusTotal, making it useful as a unique threat source.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchFurther, many of the RAT IP addresses are located on residential (and dynamically allocated) networks. RAT operators often 
run the RAT control panel from home because proxies introduce latency which degrades performance, especially when 
the RAT operator is interested in collecting live video feeds from a victim’s camera (“webcam”).  In those countries where 
the unauthorized access of a computer is a crime, law enforcement need only send a subpoena (or equivalent) to the 
respective Internet Service Provider to identify the likely RAT operator’s identity and residential location.

Between August 17-21, 2015 Shodan RAT results were collected and a list of 471 unique RAT controller locations were 
identified23.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchUsing the results from July and August 2105, the RAT controller locations were further enriched to understand individual 
instances, the corresponding RAT operators, and their respective motivations.

Enriching Intelligence 

As previously mentioned, VirusTotal further confirms and enriches the RAT controller results with associated malware 
metadata. Additional valuable enrichment sources that are programmatically available include Team Cymru and Recorded 
Future. 

Recorded Future’s API offers valuable open source verdict confirmation and data enrichment. The Python API script used 
to produce the full Recorded Future results for the consolidated list of RAT IP addresses is located on Recorded Future’s 
GitHub page.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchProactive RAT Operator Attribution
Example 1 – VirusTotal 

Earlier this year Shodan identified a Dark Comet controller running on 90.212.68.218 (Sky Broadband) in the United Kingdom. 

Quick  IP  address  enrichment  included  VirusTotal’s  associated  malware  sample  with  filename,  “DeathBotnet!.exe”  and 
domain – yobrohasan[.]ddns.net. “Yobrohasan” is a distinct string that leads to a cached image on the now defunct snog.
com of an individual using the moniker “yobrohasan.”

It’s impossible to fully attribute this particular Dark Comet instance to the above individual, as the RAT operator may have 
purposefully chosen the “yobrohasan” sub-domain in an attempt at a disinformation campaign, or perhaps the subdomain 
was chosen due to dislike for the aforementioned individual, or the subdomain choice may have been a coincidence. As 
previously mentioned, attribution is difficult, and this example serves as a good reminder for the remainder of this report.

11

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchExample 2 – Team Cymru

In July 2015, Team Cymru observed a high port UDP session between a njRAT controller IP address – 5.28.184.242 (Ramat 
Gan Hot Internet, Israel) and a host at 196.36.153.134 (Internet Solutions, South Africa).  

In addition to identifying njRAT on port 1177, Shodan further identified UPnP running on port 1900 and HTTP services 
running on port 80 and 8080 (“WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=”NETGEAR DGN2200v2BEZEQ”) respectively, potentially 
indicating that the 5.28.184.242 host is also acting as a proxy. 

In June, 2015, Team Cymru identified a DNS A record for xheemax.x64.me resolving to 5.28.184.242. The subdomain 
“xheemax” is a unique string used to produce a new domain from the DDNS service x64.me. The domain currently resolves 
to 149.78.239.193 (PSINet, Israel). 

The  online  moniker  “xheemax”  appears  in  multiple  forums  beginning  in  2011  when  the  actor  asks  for  assistance  in 
“disabling the small light on the laptop webcam.”25 A profile is also maintained on CryptoSuite26 as “xheemax Hakkinda” and 
the “About Me” section contains “RAT” and “Cybergate.”

In 2014, Team Cymru’s #totalhash27 also identified xheemax.no-ip.info (204.95.99.109), with corresponding SHA1 hash 
- 329ed5ef04535f5d11d0e59a361263545d740c6128.

Example 3 – Maltego

Importing the RAT controller IP addresses – from Shodan results for August 17-21, 2015 – into Maltego reveals an enormous 
amount of commonality.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchThe nodes with the highest number of links are related to IP address location checking. The native Maltego transforms 
specifically correlate over 50 RAT controller IP addresses with websites that include localiser-ip[.]com and iplocationtools[.]
com. Multiple historic lists containing the IP addresses in question were also identified on pastebin[.]com.

13

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchVisualization  of  large  data  sets  enables  the  identification 
of  “choke  points”  –  through  commonality  –  comprised  of 
(in  this  case)  adversary  resources  and/or  tactics  that  can 
be  identified  and  addressed  by  operational  defenders  to 
increase defensive technology efficacy.

Example 4 – Recorded Future

Recorded  Future  matched  a  RAT  controller  IP  address  to 
a  Pastebin  reference  –  http://pastebin.com/cU4WX0hs    –
alleging the IP address owner is “Daniel”. The Paste author 
proceeds to list Daniel’s personally identifiable information 
(PII) including date of birth, email, and physical address near 
Oxford, UK.

The  paste  author  further  alleges  that  “Daniel”  works  for 
powerstresser[.]com – an ethically dubious “booter” service29 
designed to “stress test” servers. If the Paste information is 
correct,  this  represents  an  extremely  simple  case  of  RAT 
operator attribution.

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan EfficacyRecorded Future Threat ResearchConclusion

Original, focused, and scalable intelligence methodologies are useful for law enforcement and for defending the enterprise, 
as demonstrated here. Identifying RAT controller locations and operators before their respective RAT spreading campaigns 
begin reduces malware processing resources.

Threat  data  enrichment  sources  such  as  Recorded  Future  increase  attribution  knowledge,  in  this  case  around  RAT 
operators, which lead to enhanced understanding of motivations and derivative tools, techniques, and procedures.

Proactive  and  repeatable  Internet  enumeration  for  known  RAT  signatures  is  a  viable  methodology  for  producing  an 
operational feed of malicious observables, and more importantly, also presenting further strategic opportunities to identify 
and understand the adversary.

RAT operators are inherently vulnerable because they are often operating openly on the Internet and the RATs they buy 
or download generate unique response strings when properly interrogated. The vulnerability extends further because the 
RAT service listening on a specified port is an easy remote entry point to the attacker’s computer.

Special thanks to Shodan founder John Matherly for his support of this research.
