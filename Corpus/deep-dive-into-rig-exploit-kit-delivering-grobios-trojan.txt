A Deep Dive Into RIG Exploit Kit Delivering Grobios Trojan
May 14, 2018 | by Irshad Muhammad, Shahzad Ahmed, Hassan Faizan, Zain Gardezi
As discussed in previous blogs, exploit kit activity has been on the decline since the latter half of 2016. However, we do still periodically observe significant developments in this space, and we have been observing interesting ongoing activity involving RIG Exploit Kit (EK). Although the volume of its traffic observed in-the-wild has been on the decline, RIG EK remains active, with a wide range of associated crimeware payloads.

In this recent finding, RIG EK was observed delivering a Trojan named Grobios. This blog post will discuss this Trojan in depth with a focus on its evasion and anti-sandbox techniques, but first let’s take a quick look at the attack flow. Figure 1 shows the entire infection chain for the activity we observed.


Figure 1: Infection chain

We first observed redirects to RIG EK on Mar. 10, 2018, from the compromised domain, latorre[.]com[.]au, which had a malicious iframe injected to it (Figure 2).


Figure 2: Malicious Iframe injected in latorre[.]com

The iframe loads a malvertisement domain, which communicates over SSL (certificate shown in Figure 3) and leads to the RIG EK landing page that loads the malicious Flash file (Figure 4).

When opened, the Flash file drops the Grobios Trojan. Figure 5 shows the callback traffic from the Grobios Trojan.

Analysis of the Dropped Malware
Grobios uses various techniques to evade detection and gain persistence on the machine, which makes it hard for it to be uninstalled or to go inactive on the victim machine. It also uses multiple anti-debugging, anti-analysis and anti-VM techniques to hide its behavior. After successful installation on the victim machine, it connects to its command and control (C2) server, which responds with commands.

In an effort to evade static detection, the authors have packed the sample with PECompact 2.xx. The unpacked sample has no function entries in the import table. It uses API hashing to obfuscate the names of API functions it calls and parses the PE header of the DLL files to match the name of a function to its hash. The malware also uses stack strings. Figure 6 shows an example of the malware calling WinApi using the hashes.

Loading
The malware sample starts a copy of itself, which further injects its code into svchost.exe or IEXPLORE.EXE depending on the user privilege level. Both parent and child quit after injection is complete. Only svchost.exe/IEXPLORE.EXE keeps running. Figure 7 shows the process tree.

Persistence
The malware has an aggressive approach to persistence. It employs the following techniques:

It drops a copy of itself into the %APPDATA% folder, masquerading as a version of legitimate software installed on the victim machine. It creates an Autorun registry key and a shortcut in the Windows Startup folder. During our analysis, it dropped itself to the following path:
%APPDATA%\Google\v2.1.13554\<RandomName>.exe.

The path can vary depending on the folders the malware finds in %APPDATA%.

It drops multiple copies of itself in subfolders of a program at the path %ProgramFiles%/%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%,  again masquerading as a different version of the installed program, and sets an Autorun registry key or creates a scheduled task.
It drops a copy itself in the %Temp% folder, and creates a scheduled task to run it.
On an infected system, the malware creates two scheduled tasks, as shown in Figure 8.


Figure 8: Scheduled tasks created by the malware

The malware changes the file Created, Modified, and Accessed times of all of its dropped copies to the Last Modified time of ntdll.dll. To bypass the “File Downloaded from the Internet” warning, the malware removes the :Zone.Identifier flag using DeleteFile API, as shown in Figure 9.

An interesting behavior of this malware is that it protects its copy in the %TEMP% folder using EFS (Windows Encrypted File System), as seen in Figure 10.

Detecting VM and Malware Analysis Tools
Just before connecting to the C2, the malware does a series of checks to detect the VM and malware analysis environment. It can detect almost all well-known VM software, including Xen, QEMU, VMWare, Virtualbox, Hyper-V, and so on. The following is the list of checks it performs on the victim system:

Using the FindWindowEx API, it checks whether any of the analysis tools in Table 1 are running on the system.
Analysis Tools

PacketSniffer

FileMon

WinDbg

Process Explorer

OllyDbg

SmartSniff

cwmonitor

Sniffer

It checks whether Registry keys present at the path HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum and HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Disk\Enum contain any of these words: QEMU, VBOX, VMWARE, VIRTUAL
It checks whether registry keys at the path HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft, HKLM\SOFTWARE  contain these words: VirtualMachine, vmware, Hyber-V
It checks whether the system bios version present at registry path HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\SystemBiosVersion contains these words: QEMU, BOCHS, VBOX
It checks whether the video bios version present at registry path HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\VideoBiosVersion contains  VIRTUALBOX substring.
It checks whether the registry key at path HKLM\HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port 0\Scsi Bus 0\Target Id 0\Logical Unit Id 0\Identifier contains any of these words: QEMU,vbox, vmware
It checks whether the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Oracle\VirtualBox Guest Additions  exists on the system.
Network Communication
The malware contains two hardcoded obfuscated C2s. After de-obfuscating the C2 URLs, it generates a random string of 20 characters, appends it to the end of URL, and sends the request for commands. Before it executes the commands, the malware verifies the identity of the C2. It calculates the hash of 4 bytes of data using the CALG_MD5 algorithm. It then uses the Base64 data from the CERT command as a Public Key in CryptVerifySignature to verify the hash signature (Figure 13). If the signature is verified, the malware executes the commands.


Figure 13: Malware verifies the C2 hash

During our initial analysis, we found that the malware supports the commands shown in Table 7.

Command

Description

CERT <Base64 data>

Contains the data used to verify the identity of the C2

CONNECT <IP:Port>

Connect to given host for further commands

DISCONNECT

Close all the connections

WAIT <Number of seconds>

Wait for the number of seconds before executing the next commands

REJECT

Kind of NOP. Move on to next command after waiting for 5 second

Conclusion
Despite the decline in activity, exploit kits still continue to put users at risk – especially those running older versions of software. Enterprises need to make sure their network nodes are fully patched.

All FireEye products detect the malware in our MVX engine. Additionally, FireEye Network Security blocks delivery at the infection point.
