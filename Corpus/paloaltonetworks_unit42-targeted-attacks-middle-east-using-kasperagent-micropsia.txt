Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Using KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA

This blog is the result of joint research between Unit 42 and Eyal Sela ClearSky Cyber Security. 
Over the past few months Palo Alto Networks have been working together with ClearSky on preventing and detecting targeted attacks in the Middle East using two relatively new Microsoft Windows malware families which we call KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. In addition, our research has uncovered evidence of links between attacks using these two new malware families and two families of Google Android malware we are calling SECUREUPDATE and VAMP.
We named the first new Microsoft Windows malware family “KASPERAGENT” based on strings we found in the malware. (Note that we DO NOT believe this is a reference to Kaspersky Lab). We named the second new Microsoft Windows malware family MICROPSIA because the malware is very tightly packed making it appear smaller than it is, similar to the human condition micropsia. We named the first new Google Android malware family SECUREUPDATE because it masks its malicious updates a secure updates. We named the second new Google Android malware family VAMP because it’s focused on stealing data.
The attacks are not highly sophisticated, but the themes used, organizations and geographies targeted, as well the persistence of the attacker suggest a determined and noteworthy adversary. Some of this activity has been covered in a recent post by 360 security, however there is still a great deal of extra detail we are able to add in this report.
Starting in March 2016, Palo Alto Networks began monitoring this threat following the successful prevention of the execution of a sample of the KASPERAGENT malware on a customer system, however the malware had likely already been used in attacks as early as July, 2015.
At the time of writing, we have uncovered:

113 samples of the KASPERAGENT malware
94 samples of the MICROPSIA malware
17 samples of Android Malware which are related to this activity.
39 command and control domains registered in relation to this activity

Most of the attacks discovered so far target users in the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Egypt; although there are occasional outliers. Notable outliers include media organizations in a variety of countries.
This post will begin by exploring how the attackers attempt to gain a foothold into target networks before briefly describing the malware families used.
One Bit.ly at a time
This group of attackers favors using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails. In particular, a number of samples we analyzed were linked via the URL shortening service “bit.ly”. The URL shortening service then redirects users to the malicious payload hosted on attacker controlled pages, with the malicious payload nearly always contained in an archive file (most commonly a RAR file.) Using the statistics provided by these link-shortening services, we can gain an immediate insight into the targets clicking these links:

Figure 1: The bit.ly statistics for a link to a dropper for the MICROPSIA malware family.
The statistics vary per link, suggesting different target audiences for different waves of spear phishing. For example, the statistics shown in Figure 1 the campaign targeted 113 users in Egypt, whereas in another example shown in Figure 2, Egypt did not make the top 3 countries targeted:

FAKE NEWS!
Sending spear phishing emails with direct links to malicious shortened URLs was not the only method employed by the attackers to entice users to install the malware, another method favored by the attackers was the setting up of fake news sites.  Figure 3 shows examples of pages created by the attackers to this end.

 

Figure 3:  Two fake new sites with links to shortened malicious URLs.
We are unable to confirm how traffic was driven to these sites, the attackers may have helped drive traffic via fake social media accounts, or they may have sent spear phishing links to these pages.

Malware Analysis: MICROPSIA, KASPERAGENT and the missing link
During our analysis, we discovered two distinct malware families which for the most part leveraged distinct infrastructure with no overlaps, initially leading us to categorize these campaigns separately. Later, we discovered a key link between the two sets of activity which leads us to believe they are related.
The MICROPSIA activity centers around domains registered using the email address adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com – and no samples of KASPERAGENT talk to these domains. However, one of the domains (drive.acount-manager[.]net) registered by this address was used to host a sample (babf156ede8b5c2e6c961b6ffcccc5eb7a3d283b398370754061613f439d40f9) of KASPERAGENT, causing us to link the two sets of activity.
KASPERAGENT
We have named the most common malware involved in this campaign, KASPERAGENT, due to PDB strings left behind in many samples of the malware. An example of a PDB string left behind is given below:




c:\Users\USA\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\New folder (2)\kasper\Release\kasper.pdb




1

c:\Users\USA\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\New folder (2)\kasper\Release\kasper.pdb





This analysis is based on the following file:
SHA256: babd654ef363e0645ce374dd9e2a42afe339c52f1cf17fc2285d8bebd3cfa11e
The file is compressed using the legitimate tool “mpress.exe” and once executed drops the payload to the directory C:\vault\igfxtray.exe which has the SHA256 hash f26caee34184b6a53ecbc0b5ce1f52e17d39af2129561dd6361fb4d4364e2c8b.
The malware also drops a decoy document containing Arabic names and ID numbers to the same folder and displays it to the user.
KASPERAGENT is developed in Microsoft Visual C++ and attempts to disguise itself as a product that does not exist: “Adobe Cinema Video Player”. The malware first establishes persistence using the classic method of adding a Run key, using the value “MediaSystem”.
The malware connects to a C2 serverhosted on www.mailsinfo[.]net. The C2 server string in the binary is “obfuscated” in the most basic of senses, with the author adding ‘@’  characters between letters and splitting the starting “www.m” to another string.

Figure 4: The Command and Control domain is obfuscated using a basic technique
Most of the samples of KASPERAGENT use “Chrome” as the user agent, but this recent sample uses “OPAERA”, possibly a misspelling of “Opera”, the browser.
The malware communicates with the C2 server via HTTP requests and in the most recent samples observed the callbacks are made to PHP scripts whose names relate to towns or navigation. Example URLs used include:

GET request to /dad5/town.php
POST request to /dad5/addCity.php and /dad5/sign.php

Most examples of the malware are nearly identical, and the malware simply acts as a basic reconnaissance tool and downloader for further payloads, however some examples of the malware include extended capabilities beyond that of a simple downloader. Examples of the extended-capability KASPERAGENT samples include:

a52d3e65fe5bbf57bab79b1c5092b66d9650247249b72f667a927f266d09efe6
c9ffb81a97a9458f1fc96f35cd187b1d7311479e77d031586abdc3d426da0859
7f11e0bbc892a97b7c42416c43fe178ebb240939d9dee70c3c598305ce8a2d4f

These extended-capability samples connect to www.stikerscloud[.]com and implement the following additional functionality:

Theft of passwords for Firefox and Chrome browsers
Take screenshots
Recording user keystrokes
Exfiltrate basic environment information such as the username and computer name
Perform arbitrary commands
Enumerate removable drives and copy files of interest to a new folder for exfiltration
Update the malware to a new version
Exfilitrate arbitrary files (zip compressed and encrypted)

It’s also worth mentioning that sometimes that both versions of the malware are wrapped in a Microsoft .NET Framework loader which is responsible for deploying the malware and displaying the decoy document. The author (imaginatively) calls this wrapper ‘Loader’ an example of this is the file is 4c1973278a30d1b4ce206eca63676624d234260758a0674d191d338a02914d23, which contains the PDB string: C:\Users\Yousef\Desktop\MergeFiles\Loader v0\Loader\obj\Release\Loader.pdb
MICROPSIA Analysis
The MICROPSIA malware family is written in Delphi and is an information stealing malware family with a wide range of data theft functionality built in. This analysis is based on the following sample:
SHA256: 6e461a8430f251db38e8911dbacd1e72bce47a89c28956115b702d13ae2b8e3b
We named the malware MICROPSIA because of the way it is often packaged. The malware is often delivered as a RAR, which once extracted contains an EXE, which is further packed using UPX. Once unpacked from UPX, the next level is a further SFX RAR file, which then contains the actual malware files within. This effectively means the initial payload is extremely compressed and appears much smaller than it really is. The final payload contains four legitimate executables as resources:

Two embedded DLLs relating to the OpenSSL library used for traffic encryption.
A copy of a command line version of WinRAR – used for encrypting and compressing the exfiltrated data
The file ‘shortcut.exe’ from optimumx.com (Creates, modifies or queries Windows shell links)
this is used for persistence by creating a link in the startup folder to the payload.

The malware begins execution by first copying itself to a predefined location, setting up persistence via an LNK file (hence the inclusion of the aforementioned shortcut.exe)
The main capabilities of the malware are as follows:

Logging of keystrokes to a hardcoded text file and exfiltration to a remote server
Capturing screenshots of the infected machines
Searching for files with extensions matching Microsoft Office documents and using WinRAR to archive these prior to exfiltration. Example syntax of the command used is as follows:






"Rar.exe a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hpd58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf270 -ta2016-12-11 ProgramData\Recovery\bin\sys\sysTime\LMth_E E:\*.xls E:\*.doc"




1

"Rar.exe a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hpd58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf270 -ta2016-12-11 ProgramData\Recovery\bin\sys\sysTime\LMth_E E:\*.xls E:\*.doc"





The value “d58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf27” is used to encrypt exfiltrated documents and appears to be an MD5 hash, but we have not identified a string that maps to this hash.
A side of phishing
Interestingly in some cases the attackers combined an attempt to infect targeted users with malware, with an attempt to steal their credentials via traditional phishing techniques. The attackers sometimes directed users to sites spoofing legitimate services such as Google Drive to download the malware, however first the target users would be asked to fill in their credentials in, giving the attackers two chances to successfully steal target users’ data (via the phish and via the eventual malware infection):

 

Figure 5: In some cases, users were required to fill in their credentials to download the malware
And there’s an APK twist…
Whilst a large number of the domains associated with the adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com email address are associated with MICROPSIA samples, some have been observed hosting Android apps or acting as C2 domains for Android malware samples. Analysis of these apps shows these are also malicious, and the apps also contain some social engineering tricks to enable installation.
There are two main APK malware families used by the threat actor. The first is a malware family used to gain a foothold on to the device, it is effectively a downloader with no additional functionality and we call this malware SECUREUPDATE.
 
Figure 6: The applications often pretend to be social applications popular with end users.
In the sample we analyzed (6b4d65abf95cfb3cedd39b217ff0e4ee2229ae32aeda5170f34c5a3b9c5a0f3) the malware used the local calendar to sleep, creating an alarm in the future, at which point the malware would call back to receive an “Update”:

Figure 7: The alarm functionality in the SECUREPDATE malware was used to download and execute a further payload at a later date.
In a similar vein to the ‘a side of phishing’ section, some of the versions of SECUREUPDATE backdoor attempt to steal credentials for users, making them create accounts for these fake apps in addition to the installation of the malware. This technique relies on credential re-use across many accounts but will still yield some success for the attackers:

Figure 8: Some of the apps require users to “Login” giving the attacker the chance to record credentials of victims that may well be reused elsewhere.
The second malware family is a malware family we call VAMP, which is already described in great detail in the blog by 360, VAMP is fully featured with all the capabilities you’d expect from a malware family that resides on a phone. Features of the malware include:

Ability to record calls
Contact theft
Theft of documents stored on the device
Theft of messages

Another outlier in terms of domains registered by adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com  is the domain AppPure[.]info. From the outset, the site appears to be a legitimate page:

Figure 9: The app store created by the attackers which we believe was used to distribute malicious apps.
Although we have been unable to find malicious content hosted on this site, we believe that it is very likely that amongst the many legitimate apps available for download via this store some malicious apps may exist.
Concluding thoughts
Through this campaign there is little doubt that the attackers have been able to gain a great deal of information from their targets. We have been unable to uncover any evidence which allows us to confidently attribute this campaign to any known threat actor at present.
The scale of the campaign in terms of sheer numbers of samples and the maintenance of several differing malware families involved suggests a reasonably sized team and that the campaign is not being perpetrated by a lone wolf, but rather a small team attackers.
The campaign also illustrates that for some targets old tricks remain sufficient to run a successful espionage campaign, including use of URL shortening services, classic phishing techniques as well as using archive files to bypass some simple file checks.
