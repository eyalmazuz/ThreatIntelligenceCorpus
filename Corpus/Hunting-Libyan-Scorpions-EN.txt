Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

 
Executive Summary 

Libya maybe known in non-stable political system, civil war and militant groups fighting for the land and oil 
control but it is definitely not known in cyber malicious activities, cyber espionage and hacking groups. No 
parties in Libya before this analysis reported to use cyber attacks, malwares nor recruit hackers to spy on their 
rivals. Today we have a different story. 

In the past weeks on 6 August 2016, Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) received a numerous 
Android malwares operating in different areas in Libya especially in Tripoli and Benghazi. 

The malware spreads very fast using Telegram messenger application in smartphones, targeting high-profile 
Libyan influential and political figures. 

The  malware  first  discovery  was  after  a  highly  Libyan  influential  Telegram  account  compromised  via  web 
Telegram using IP address from Spain. 

The following day, the attackers spread an Android malware binded with legitimate Android application from 
the compromised Telegram account to all his contacts pretending it is an important voice message (misspelled 
it by “Voice Massege.apk”) which indicates a non-english (maybe an Arabic) attacker. 

After spreading the malware, more Android smartphones has been infected using the same technique (via 
Telegram) and then repost the malware again and again making a network of victims. 

Analysis of this incident led us to believe that this operation and the group behind it which we call Libyan 
Scorpions is a malware operation in use since September 2015 and operated by a politically motivated group 
whose  main  objective  is  intelligence  gathering,  spying  on  influentials  and  political  figures  and  operate  an 
espionage campaign within Libya. 

Also, the analysis of the incident led to the discovery of multiple malwares targeting Android and Windows 
machines. 

Libyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to 
have  highly  technical  skills  but  a  good  social  engineering  and  phishing  tricks.  The  threat  actors  are  not 
particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don’t need to be sophisticated in order 
to be effective. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Using malwares as weapon in an active warzone such as Libya, make 
the victims easy targets for assassination or kidnapping by tracking 
their physical locations and monitoring them day and night.

Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

 
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) 

Libyan Scorpions is believed to be a political motivated group targeting a high-level influential and political 
figures in multiple cities within Libya.  
 
Libyan Scorpions first compromised a personal Telegram account for a Libyan influential person with 
unknown vector. The victim received a push notification from his Telegram app that someone from Spain is 
logged into his account: 
 

The  victim  mistakenly  deleted  Telegram  application  from  his  phone  thinking  that  this  is  going  to  stop  the 
attacker(s). 

Second day, the attacker used the victim phone number to spear phish his contacts in Telegram by pretending 
that the real person is sending a voice message while the file is actually a malicious APK (Android Package) file. 

 

This  APK  file  targets  only  Android-based  smartphones.  Once  the  new  victim  click  on  the  APK  file,  the 
application installs itself in the device without any problem and is fully functional. The icon of the application 
appears in the Apps menu named (URL Shortener).

Malware Analysis 

Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) started analyzing the APK file (malware) and the first step 
was to unpack it. 

After unpacking with apktool and reading (AndroidManifest.xml) file, it appears that the application is a 
malware injected inside a legitimate application having java package name: 
de.keineantwort.android.urlshortener.

The application exists in the store and the Libyan Scorpions hacking group took an instance of the APK and 
injected their malware into that legitimate application to spread it. 

The real application is created by keineantwort.de and we have verified it from their main website: 

Going back to (AndroidManifest.xml) file, the malware register itself as receiver of almost all intents and 
request almost all permissions available in Android system!

The malware can access location, network state, battery status, Bluetooth, camera, capturing audio, 
internet, …, etc. 

After launching the malicious application for the first time, it checks if the Android device is rooted or not 
and if rooted, it asks for root permission.

Hunting Libyan Scorpions 

Carrying on the reverse engineering of the malware, we found a file called “config.json” which is a base64 
encoded json file containing the configuration of the malware and its Command and Control (C2). The 
characteristics of the malware (“a.txt” and “config.json” files) and the functionality of it is very similar to 
JSocket and AlienSpy famous Android Remote Access Tools (RATs). 

Decoding the “config.json” file using base64 decoder shows that the C2 hostname/domain is: 

winmeif.myq-see.com using the port 64631 

Resolving the hostname gives: 41.208.110.46 which is a static Libyan IP address owned by Libya Telecom 
and Technology Backbone.

The picture below showing that the malware is capable of taking pictures from the camera of the 
compromised device and upload it to the C2. 

The malware begins by implementing a Trust Manager that accepts all certificates so that Libyan Scorpions 
hackers are sure no victim left disconnected due to SSL certificates issues.

The malware uses Allatori Java Obfuscator to protect the code and make it harder to reverse engineer and it 
obviously uses communication protocol based on Java JSON objects encapsulated in SSL connection wrapper. 
Again, this behavior and characteristics of the malware is very similar to JSocket and AlienSpy Android RATs. 

After finalizing the analysis of the Android malware, Cyberkov uploaded it to VirusTotal to see if it has been 
uploaded before and what information we can get from it:

Command and Control Communication 

Cyberkov tried to discover the attacker behind this malicious application by sinkholing the malware and 
analyzing the real C2. 

Sinkhole 
Cyberkov created a fake server simulating the real C2 of the Libyan Scorpions hacking group and sinkholed 
the malware to study the behavior of the malware deeply. 

Upon connection to the C2, the malware sends a lot of information about the target including: Country, 
Malware Path, Local IP Address, RAM, Android Version, Device Name, …, etc.

Real C2 
By connecting to the real C2 IP address, Cyberkov found that the malware is really of JSocket/AlienSpy family 
of RATs since that family of RATs open the port 1234 with a self-signed certificate of “assylias”2. 

According to Shodan, the port (1234) has been spotted open since 12-07-2016 which is 25 days before the 
first discovery.

Seems like the Libyan Scorpions threat actors are running multiple Android RATs since numerous ports 
protected by SSL layer are open in (winmeif.myq-see.com) machine. 

Also, the Libyan Scorpions threat actors left phpinfo.php script on the webserver running on port 80 with 
useful information that could expose them. Their machine is running Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1.

Threat Actors Infrastructure 

Going back to the IP address of the attackers (41.208.110.46), it is very important to discover the attackers 
infrastructure that maybe used to launch wider attacks using multiple RATs on multiple platforms. 

By using Threat Intelligence Platforms and Feeds such as PassiveTotal, Cyberkov was able to discover more 
activities and campaigns run by Libyan Scorpions. 

The  following  Heatmap  shows  that  the  IP  address  (41.208.110.46)  has  been  used  to  launch  attacks  since 
9/9/2015 until the time of writing this report using 5 different hostnames and multiple malicious malwares. 

The following table summarizes the list of hostnames used by the attacker(s):
