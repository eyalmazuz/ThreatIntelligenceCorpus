Introduction   

 

Increasingly, cyberattacks targeting various industrial sectors are directed towards prominent institutions. In a 
recent incident reported on April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde, one of France’s largest global television networks was 
attacked by hackers, resulting in the disruption of eleven TV5 Monde’s channels. According to TV5 Monde, a 
hacker group claiming to be linked to the Islamic State Group executed the attack.   

 

This report analyzes the malwares used in the targeted attack against TV5 Monde in France.   

 

 

Attack Outline   

At 10 pm on April  8, 2015,  TV5 Monde fell victim to a cyberattack  by Islamic fundamentalist hacker group, 
“Cyber  Caliphate”,  which  claims  to  be  linked  to  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS).  Back  in  January 
2015, this group hacked into the official Twitter account of the United States Central Command.   

In this incident, 11 programme broadcasts of TV5 Monde channels were disrupted for 3 hours as the hacker 
group  breaches  the  Network’s  internal  systems  and  overriding  the  digital  broadcast  system.  The  hacker 
group also took control of the Network’s administrative systems making emails inaccessible. The Network’s 
social  media  accounts  and  website  were  not  spared.  The  Network’s  Facebook  account  was  hacked,  and 
made to display images of ISIS.

Complete details on the attack  are still uncertain,  but  the Network’s soft approach to security  was exposed 
on live television.

A  live  interview  with  a  reporter  the  next  day  of  the  attack  displayed  usernames  and  passwords  written  on 
post-it notes. One of the post-it notes revealed the network's passwords for YouTube. Twitter user “pent0thal” 
confirmed that the password was "lemotdepassedeyoutube," which translates in English to "the password of 
YouTube."

The  same  user,  pent0thal,  discovered  another  password  in  a  publicly  broadcasted  segment  of  the  news, 
which  can  be  seen  above.  TV5Monde’s  negligent  approach  to  security,  like  writing  account  information  on 
notepads pasted on walls, may have contributed to the hacking incident. 

 

On April 9, 2015, Blue Coat, a security vendor, released a press statement on the TV5Monde attack.

According to this statement, the malware used in the TV5 Monde attack is a variant of Njworm that is popular 
in the Middle East. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Findings #1: Njrat and Njworm, based in the Middle East 

A  Kuwaiti,  known  by  the  alias  “njq8”,  created  NjRAT  and  Njworm.  A  simple  search  on  the  web  shows  that 
there  are  numerous  online  video  tutorials  in  the  Arabic  language  sharing  knowledge  on  executing  and 
exploiting  with  njRAT  and  Njworm.  This  level  of  knowledge  sharing  and  support  is  making  the  backdoor 
malware popular among attackers in the Middle-East region.

Many variants of this malware have been found ever since the source code was disclosed in May 2013. A C# 
source code generator was even uploaded on an Arabic developer’s site on December 8, 2014. 

With the increase in threats involving this malware, Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) took down 
the  NjRAT  and  Njworm malware  families  in  June  2014.  These malware  families  are  believed to have been 
created by Kuwaiti, Naser Al Mutairi, aka njq8, and Algerian, Mohamed Benabdellah, aka Houdini. 

There  is  also  VB  source  code  generators.  The  VBS  codes  are  slightly  different  as  compared  to  the  C# 
source  code  generator,  but  it  performs  the  same  action  –  stealing  personal  information  and  acting  as  a 
backdoor. When the  VB  source code  generator  runs,  the  attacker must  enter  the  port  number,  and specify 
the host address, name, directory and installation name. The output files created could be slightly different. 

 

 

 

 

Findings #2: Source code generator and generation process 

Let’s take a look at how some source code generators work. 

1. Source Code Generator 1 

When you execute the generator, a  window to set the port will appear. Then, a message stating the port is 
successfully connected will appear as below. 

[Figure 6] Port connected 

 

 

If  you  right-click  on  the  white  bar  on  the  message  above,  a  window  will  appear  to  send  commands.  The 
command types are  divided into  w0rm, Computer, Run and Options, and you can send various commands 
based on the command type. 

[Figure 7] Command window 

 

 

After selecting a command, and clicking  Builder, a  window to initialize the IP  and port  will  appear.  You can 
specify the host, port, name and install name, and select one of the six directories.

2. Source Code Generator 2 

Let us take a look at another source code generator. When  you open the generator, a  window to enter the 
port number as in [Figure 9] and a window to specify a few settings as in [Figure 10] will appear.

The command type is simpler. The options are only Run File, VBS Code and Uninstall Worm. 

 

 

[Figure 11] Command window 

 

You  can  specify  the  host,  port,  name  and  install  name.  The  Spread  File  Name  and  directory  has  been 
modified.

The  biggest  difference  between  the  two  source  code  generators  is  the  process  to  verify  whether  the 
environment is a virtual environment or physical environment.   

Source Code Generator 1 does not include a function to verify the environment.   

On the other hand, Source Code Generator 2 offers vmcheck() function at the beginning of the exploit codes, 
where  if  it  is  verified  that  the  environment  is  verified  as  virtual,  the  exploit  code  jumps  to  a  process  that 
immediately deletes the VBS file and terminates. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Findings #3: VB script backdoor 

The  malware  used  in  TV5Monde  attack  is  a  VBS  (Visual  Basic  Script)  malware  created  with  one  of  these 
source code generators. It steals personal information and allows remote control, and performs the following 
actions: 

1. Create files 

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\SecurityNajaf.vbs 

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\LocalSettings\Temp\(Original).vbs 

2. Enable auto-run via Registry 

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SecurityNajaf 
"SecurityNajaf.vbs"" 

"wscript.exe 

//B 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SecurityNajaff 
"SecurityNajaf.vbs"" 

"wscript.exe 

//B 

3. Communicate with C&C server 

The  scripts  are  divided  into  initialization  codes  and  backdoor  codes.  The  initialization  codes  contain  install 
name, IP and port details.

The backdoor codes define the action of the commands sent to the C&C server.

This malware not only acts as a backdoor, but also steal user information that includes user name, computer 
name, volume serial number and Windows version.

The  originating  address  of  the  detected  malware  was  the  malware  itself,  so  it  is  determined  and  highly 
possible that it was created for testing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conclusion 

AhnLab  has  investigated  the  malware  that  seized  control  of  France’s  TV5Monde  and  disrupting  the 
broadcast of 11 TV5Monde’s channels. Television networks are the perfect targets for cyber-attacks intended 
for political reasons and it has been proven possible for attackers to take control of the television broadcast. 
Television  broadcast  companies  have  an  immediate  need  to  reinforce  security  and  take  targeted  attacks 
seriously. Malware that are widely used in specific countries or regions could be executed as political attacks, 
so it is also important to be up-to-date about these malware.
