Updated Blackmoon banking Trojan stays focused on South Korean banking customers
First analyzed in early 2014 [1] [2], the Blackmoon banking Trojan targets a user’s online banking credentials using a type of pharming that involves modifying or replacing the local Hosts file with one that redirects online banking domain lookups to an IP address controlled by the attacker. Blackmoon has been observed targeting primarily customers of South Korean online banking sites and services, and is usually distributed via drive-by download.
Like other banking Trojans targeting online banking users in other countries, Blackmoon continues to evolve both their distribution and delivery technique. Proofpoint threat researchers recently observed a sample of the Blackmoon Korean banking Trojan (7e67216628d9a171be0ce18c51fda8ce) retrieving encoded configuration information from the “lofter[.]com” blogging platform.

Executable Process 
The malware arrives on the system as an executable. (The original delivery method of this sample is unknown, but previous analyses have found it spreading via download from an infected site.)

Once executed, the dropper extracts a DLL from itself and launches the DLL via rundll32.exe, calling the dropper filename as a parameter that deletes the original dropper from disk. The DLL and the folder it resides in are named using 6 random alphabetical characters.

The malware sets persistence by running the command

Figure 5: Blackmoon DLL persistence setting in registry key
The malware calls out to a hardcoded website address to retrieve the encoded configuration block. It parses the page looking for “###” and extracts the data until a subsequent “###”: this is the encoded configuration block (Fig. 6).

Figure 6: The encoded Blackmoon configuration block.
The malware makes use of JavaScript to handle the encoding and decoding of strings. The decoding can be described as case-swapped base64 with a substituted padding character of ‘@‘. (A python script for decoding is included at end of this post.).

Figure 8: Decoded Configuration Block
The malware also utilizes this encoding to register the infected host.

Figure 9: Blackmoon infected client check-in

Figure 10: Decoded SID parameter for infected client
The malware clears the DNS resolver cache by running the command ipconfig.exe /flushdns, and then sets the values found in the [Dns] section of the config block to the infected client’s DNS server settings. In this case it is 127.0.0.1 with the Google primary public DNS server of 8.8.8.8 as a backup.
With the primary DNS set to the loopback address, the malware rewrites the infected client’s Hosts file with search engine and banking sites that will resolve to the attacker's server. The list of domains to redirect is hardcoded in the malware. The value in the [Host] field of the configuration block replaces “IP#“ when it is written to the Hosts file.

Figure 11: The Modified HOSTS file before (right) and after (left) the IP from the Configuration Block is replaced.
The malware also searches for a folder “\NPKI\” containing .cer or .der files on the infected client. If found, the malware extracts a command line RAR executable from itself and saves it to “\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Temp” as “zip.tmp”. Then the malware archives the NPKI folder with the following command:
zip.tmp a -hp@#@2016999# "D:\NPKI.z" "D:\NPKI"
The malware will then send the password protected archive to the value of the [Upload] field in the configuration block via HTTP POST. It is likely that the content of the NPKI folder are used to impersonate an end-user in order to access their online banking information and accounts. [3] [4]

Figure 12: The Blackmoon DLL sending NPKI RAR archive 
The configuration block also includes a [Time] value that indicates how often the malware checks for a new configuration block.
Once the infected client’s Hosts file has been updated with the redirected domains, a user visiting any of the search engine sites with the infected client will often see the following message:

Figure 13: Message displayed when user of infected client visits a domain listed in modified Hosts file
This message roughly translates to:
Financial Supervisory Service is conducting an authentication process did you install the security certificate for this PC? 
※ Certificate must verify the security and privacy of information leakage incidents in the auction using Internet banking Guests prevent financial fraud, please see below. 
※ You cannot access the Internet Banking more safely receive the security certification process. 
※ Please click the bank name that you use to proceed to the secure authentication procedures.
A user who clicks on one of these online banking site names in order to login would be presented with the following sequence pages:

Figure 14: Fake online banking web site using stolen branding
While this page appears legitimate, clicking on any element on the page brings up an alert.

Figure 15: Fraudulent security notification to end user 
This roughly translates to:
Safer internet 03.24.2014 (Will) for banking using internet banking, smart Banking, Phone Banking To The use of all services (private. Company) can then use additional authentication. 
Clicking the OK button brings up a brief loading message:

Figure 16: Loading message displayed when user accepts warning
Which is then followed by a two-stage credential theft phish.

Figure 17: First page of credential theft phishing, with stolen branding

Figure 18: Second page of credential theft phishing, with stolen branding
The phishing pages include user input validation capabilities that surpass those typically found in phishing pages, such as validating that the user has entered their name using the proper character set, as well as numerous checks to ensure that a valid “Social Security number” (officially called a Resident Registration Number in South Korea) has been entered.

This infection chain is consistent with examples documented in early 2014, with two noteworthy updates to distribution and delivery technique:
These changes are consistent with updates Proofpoint researchers have recently observed in other malware, from highly targeted malware such as the Operation Arid Viper payload [5] to broad-based campaigns such as those distributing Dridex [6]. Organizations can expect to see continued variation in obfuscation techniques and distribution as attackers attempt to stay ahead of evolving defenses.
