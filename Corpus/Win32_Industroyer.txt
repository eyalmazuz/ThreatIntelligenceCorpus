Win32/IndustroyerWin32/Industroyer: a new threat for 
industrial control systems
Win32/Industroyer is a sophisticated piece of malware designed to disrupt 
the working processes of industrial control systems (ICS), specifically 
industrial control systems used in electrical substations 
Those behind the Win32/Industroyer malware have a deep knowledge 
and understanding of industrial control systems and, specifically, the 
industrial protocols used in electric power systems  Moreover, it seems very 
unlikely anyone could write and test such malware without access to the 
specialized equipment used in the specific, targeted industrial environment 
Support for four different industrial control protocols, specified in the 
standards listed below, has been implemented by the malware authors:
•  IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101)
•  IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104)
•  IEC 61850
•  OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA)
In addition to all that, the malware authors also wrote a tool that 
implements a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a particular family of 
protection relays, specifically the Siemens SIPROTEC range 
All this considered, the Win32/Industroyer malware authors show an 
intensive focus that suggests they are highly specialized in industrial 
control systems 
The capabilities of this malware are significant  When compared to the 
toolset used by threat actors in the 2015 attacks against the Ukrainian 
power grid which culminated in a black out on December 23, 2015 
(BlackEnergy, KillDisk, and other components, including legitimate 
remote access software) the gang behind Industroyer are more advanced, 
since they went to great lengths to create malware capable of directly 
controlling switches and circuit breakers  We have seen indications that 

2

this malware could have been the tool used by attackers to cause the 
power outage in Ukraine in December 2016, although at the time of 
writing, it is not confirmed, and the investigation is still ongoing  The 
infection vector remains unknown 
The malware contains multiple modules, as analyzed and described in the 
next sections of this whitepaper  However, before diving into those details, 
the following simplified schematic shows the connections between the 
components of the malware 

Figure 1  Simplified schematic of Win32/Industroyer components 

While some components (e g  Data wiper) are similar in concept to the 2015 
BlackEnergy attacks against power grid companies in Ukraine, we don’t see 
any link between those attacks and the code in this malware 

Win32/IndustroyerMain backdoor
We refer to the core component of Industroyer as the main backdoor  The 
main backdoor is used by the attackers behind Industroyer to control all 
other components of the malware 
As backdoors go, this component is pretty straightforward, connecting 
to its remote C&C server using HTTPS and receiving commands from 
the attackers  All analyzed samples are hardcoded to use the same proxy 
address, located in the local network  Thus, the backdoor is clearly designed 
to work only in one specific organization  It is also worth mentioning that 
most of the C&C servers used by this backdoor are running Tor software 
Perhaps the most interesting feature of this backdoor is that attackers 
can define a specific hour of the day when the backdoor will be active  
For example, the attackers can modify the backdoor in this way so it will 
communicate with its C&C server only outside working hours  This can make 
detection based only on network traffic examination harder  However, all the 
samples analyzed so far are set to work 24 hours round the clock 

Figure 2  The decompiled main backdoor code has a check for time-of-day

Once connected to its remote C&C server, the main backdoor component 
sends the following data in a POST-request:
•  the globally unique identifier (GUID) string for the current hardware 

profile retrieved via GetCurrentHwProfile

•  the version of the malware: 1 1e
•  the hardcoded ID of the sample
•  the result of any previously-received command
The hardcoded ID is used by the attacker as an identifier for the infected 
machine  Across all analyzed samples we found the following hardcoded ID 
values:
•  DEF
•  DEF-C
•  DEF-WS
•  DEF-EP
•  DC-2-TEMP
•  DC-2
•  CES-McA-TEMP
•  CES
•  SRV_WSUS
•  SRV_DC-2
•  SCE-WSUS01
The main backdoor component supports the following commands:

the attacker
Start a service under a specific user account

Replace "Image path" registry value for a service

Once the attackers obtain administrator privileges, they can upgrade 
the installed backdoor to a more privileged version that is executed as 
a Windows service program  To do this they pick an existing, non-critical 
Windows service and replace its ImagePath registry value with the path of 
the new backdoor’s binary 
The functionality of the main backdoor that works as a Windows service 
is the same as just described  However, there are two small differences: 
first the backdoor’s version is 1 1s, instead of 1 1e, and second, there is code 
obfuscation  The code of this version of the backdoor is mixed with junk 
assembly instructions

Figure 3  The obfuscated assembly code of the main backdoor that works as  

a Windows service 

Additional backdoor
The additional backdoor provides an alternative persistence mechanism 
that allows the attackers to regain access to a targeted network in case the 
main backdoor is detected and/or disabled 
This backdoor is a trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application  
This is a fully functional version of the application, but the malware authors 
have inserted malicious code that is executed each time the application is 
launched  Once the attackers gain administrator privileges, they are able to 
replace the legitimate Notepad manually 
The inserted malicious code is heavily obfuscated, but once the code is 
decrypted it connects to a remote C&C server, which is different to the one 
linked in the main backdoor, and downloads a payload  This is in the form 

Win32/Industroyerof shellcode that is loaded directly into memory and executed  In addition, 
the inserted code decrypts the original Windows Notepad code, which 
is stored at the end of the file, and then passes execution to it  Thus, the 
Notepad application works as expected 

Figure 4  Comparison between original Notepad binary code (at the left)  

and backdoored binary code

Launcher component
This component is a separate executable responsible for launching the 
payloads and the Data wiper component 
The Launcher component contains a specific time and date  Analyzed 
samples contained two dates, 17th December 2016 and 20th December 2016  
Once one of these dates is reached the component creates two threads  
The first thread makes attempts to load a payload DLL, while the second 
thread waits one or two hours (it depends on the Launcher component 
version) and then attempts to load the Data wiper component  The priority 
for both threads is set to THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST, which means that 
these two threads receive a higher than normal share of CPU resources 
from the operating system 
The name of the payload DLL is supplied by the attackers via a command 
line parameter supplied in one of the main backdoor’s “execute a shell 
command” commands  The Data wiper component is always named  
haslo.‌dat  The expected command lines are of the form:

%LAUNCHER%.exe‌%WORKING_DIRECTORY%‌%PAYLOAD%.dll‌

%CONFIGURATION%.ini

Each argument on the command line represents the following:
•  %LAUNCHER%.exe is the filename of the Launcher component
•  %WORKING_DIRECTORY% is the directory where the payload DLL and 

configuration is stored

•  %PAYLOAD%.dll is the filename of the payload DLL
•  %CONFIGURATION%.ini is the file that stores configuration data for the 
specified payload  The path to this file is supplied to the payload DLL by 
the Launcher component

The payload and Data wiper components are standard Windows DLL files  
In order to be loaded by the Launcher component they must export a 
function named Crash as seen in Figure 5 

Win32/Industroyer6

Windows device names (usually COM ports), the number of Information 
Object Address (IOA) ranges, and the beginning and ending IOA values 
for the specified number of IOA ranges  IOA is a number that identifies 
a particular data element in the device  Figure 6 illustrates a 101 payload 
configuration file with two defined IOA ranges, 10-15 and 20-25 

Figure 5  Example payload DLL that has internal name Crash101.dll  

and Crash export function 

101 payload component
This payload DLL has the filename 101.dll and is named after IEC 101 (aka 
IEC 60870-5-101), an international standard that describes a protocol for 
monitoring and controlling electric power systems  The protocol is used for 
communication between industrial control systems and Remote Terminal 
Units (RTUs)  The actual communication is transmitted through a serial 
connection 
The 101 payload component partly implements the protocol described in 
the IEC 101 standard and is able to communicate with an RTU or any other 
device with support for that protocol 
Once executed, the 101 payload component parses the configuration stored 
in its INI file  The configuration may contain several entries: process name, 

Figure 6  An example of a 101 payload DLL configuration 

The name of the process specified in the configuration belongs to an 
application the attackers suspect is running on the victim machine  It 
should be the application the victim machine uses to communicate 
through serial connection with the RTU  The 101 payload attempts to 
terminate the specified process and starts to communicate with the 
specified device, using the CreateFile, WriteFile and ReadFile 
Windows API functions  The first COM port from the configuration file is 
used for the actual communication and the two other COM ports are just 
opened to prevent other processes accessing them  Thus, the 101 payload 
component is able to take over and maintain control of the RTU device 
This component iterates through all IOAs in the defined IOA ranges  
For each such IOA it constructs two “select and execute” packets, one 
with a single command (C_SC_NA_1) and one with a double command 
(C_DC_NA_1) and sends these to the RTU device  The main goal of the 
component is to change the On/Off state of single command type IOA 

Win32/Industroyerand double command type IOA  Specifically, the 101 payload has three 
stages: in the first stage this component attempts to switch IOAs to their 
Off state, in the second stage it attempts to invert IOA states to On, and 
in the final stage the component switches IOA states to Off again 

7

104 payload component
This payload DLL has the filename 104 dll and is named after IEC 104 (aka 
IEC 60870-5-104), an international standard  The IEC 104 protocol extends 
IEC 101, so the protocol can be transmitted over a TCP/IP network 
Due to its highly configurable nature, this payload can be customized 
by the attackers for different infrastructures  Figure 8 shows what a 
configuration file may look like 

Figure 8  An example of 104 payload DLL configuration 

Once executed, the 104 payload DLL attempts to read its configuration file  
As described above, the path for the configuration file is supplied by the 
Launcher component 
The configuration contains a STATION section followed by properties 
that configure how the 104 payload should work  The configuration may 
contain multiple STATION entries

Once the configuration file is read, the 104 payload creates a thread for 
each STATION section defined in the configuration file  In each such 
thread, the 104 payload will attempt to communicate with the specified 
IP address using the protocol described in the IEC 104 standard  Before the 
connection is made, the 104 payload attempts to terminate the legitimate 
process that is normally responsible for IEC 104 communication with the 
device  It does so only if the stop_comm_service property is specified 
in its configuration  By default, the 104 payload terminates the process 
named D2MultiCommService.exe, or the process name specified in its 
configuration 
The main idea behind the 104 payload is relatively simple  It connects to 
the specified IP address and starts to send packets with the ASDU address 
that was defined in its configuration  The goal of this communication is to 
interact with an IOA of a single command type 
In the configuration file, the attacker can define the operation property to 
specify exactly how single command type IOAs will be iterated 
The first such operation mode is the range mode  The attackers use 
this mode in order to discover possible IOAs in the targeted device  The 
attackers have to take this approach because the protocol described in 
the IEC 104 standard does not provide a specific method to obtain such 
information 

Win32/IndustroyerThe range mode has two stages  During the first stage, once the range of 
IOAs is obtained from the configuration file, the 104 payload connects to 
the target IP address and starts to iterate through the specified IOAs  To 
each such IOA the 104 payload sends “select and execute” packets in order 
to switch the state and to confirm whether the IOA belongs to the single 
command type

enabled, so between loop iterations the payload flipped the switch value 
from On to Off and wrote it to the log 

Figure 9   An example of a 104 payload packet, after being dissected by Wireshark 

Once all possible IOAs from the specified range are iterated, the 104 
payload switches to the second stage of range mode  If logging is enabled, 
the payload writes Starting‌only‌success to the log  The rest of this 
second stage is an infinite loop that uses the previously discovered IOAs of 
single command type  In the loop the payload constantly sends “select and 
execute” packets  In addition, if the option change is defined, the payload 
flips the On/Off state between loop steps 
Figure 10 demonstrates the log file that was produced by the 104 payload 
during our analysis  It shows the payload iterated IOAs from 10 to 15, and 
once IOAs of the single command type were discovered, the payload 
started to use them in the loop  The configuration had the change option 

Figure 10  Example log file produced by the 104 payload

The second operation mode is the shift mode  This is very similar to 
the range mode  The attacker defines, in the configuration file, a range of 
IOAs and shift values  Once the 104 payload is activated it does everything 
the same way as in range mode; however, once all IOAs in the defined 
range are iterated, it starts to iterate over the new range  The new range is 
calculated by adding the shift values to the default range values 
The third operation mode is the sequence mode  It can be used by 
attackers once they know the values of all IOAs of the single command 
type that are supported by the connected device  This payload immediately 

Win32/Industroyerexecutes an infinite loop, sending “select and execute” packets to the IOAs 
defined in the configuration file 
Aside from its logging capability, the 104 payload can output debug 
information to the console, as seen in Figure 11 

Figure 11  The console output of the 104 payload

61850 payload component
Unlike the 101 and 104 payloads, this payload component exists as a 
standalone malicious tool comprising an executable named 61850.exe 
and the DLL‌61850.dll  It is named after the IEC 61850 standard  This 
standard describes a protocol used for multivendor communication among 
devices that perform protection, automation, metering, monitoring, and 
control of electrical substation automation systems  The protocol is very 
complex and robust, but the 61850 payload uses only a small subset of the 
protocol to produce its disruptive effect 
Once executed, the 61850 payload DLL attempts to read the configuration 
file, the path to which is supplied by the Launcher component  The 
standalone version defaults to reading its configuration from‌i.ini  The 
configuration file is expected to contain a list of IP addresses of devices 
capable of communicating via the protocol described in the IEC 61850 
standard 
If the configuration file is not present, then this component enumerates all 
connected network adaptors to determine their TCP/IP subnet masks  The 
61850 payload then enumerates all possible IP addresses for each of these 
subnet masks, and tries to connect to port 102 on each of those addresses  
Therefore, this component has the ability to discover relevant devices in the 
network automatically 
Otherwise, if a configuration file is present and it contains target IP 
addresses, this component connects to port 102 on those IP addresses and 
on IP addresses that were discovered automatically  
Once this component connects to a target host, it sends a Connection 
Request packet using the Connection Oriented Transport Protocol, as seen 
in Figure 12 

Win32/Industroyer11

Figure 12   A Connection Request packet, after dissection by Wireshark 

Figure 13  The dissected MMS getNameList request in Wireshark 

If the target device responds appropriately, the 61850 payload then sends 
an InitiateRequest packet using the Manufacturing Message Specification 
(MMS)  If the expected answer is received, it continues, sending an MMS 
getNameList request  Thereby, the component compiles a list of object 
names in a Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD) 
Next, this component enumerates the objects discovered in the previous 
step and sends the device domain-specific getNameList requests with 
each object name  This enumerates named variables in a specific domain 

Afterwards, the 61850 payload parses data received in response to these 
requests, searching for variables that contain following combinations of 
strings:
•  CSW, CF, Pos, and Model
•  CSW, ST, Pos, and stVal
•  CSW, CO, Pos, Oper, but not $T
•  CSW, CO, Pos, SBO, but not $T
The string CSW is a name for logical nodes, which are used to control 
circuit breakers and switches 
For variables that contain the Model or stVal string the 61850 payload sends 
an additional MMS Read request  For some of the variables this component 
may also issue an MMS Write request that will change its state 

Win32/IndustroyerThe 61850 payload produces a log file of its operations that contains the IP 
addresses, MMS domains, named variables and the node states (open or 
closed) of its targets 

OPC DA payload component
The OPC DA payload component implements a client for the protocol 
described in the OPC Data Access specification  OPC (OLE for Process 
Control) is a software standard and specification that is based on Microsoft 
technologies such as OLE, COM, and DCOM  The Data Access (DA) part of 
the OPC specification allows real-time data exchange between distributed 
components, based on a client–server model 
This component exists as a standalone malicious tool with the filename 
OPC.exe and a DLL, which implement both 61850 and OPC DA 
payload functionalities  This DLL is named, internally in PE export table, 
OPCClientDemo.dll, suggesting that the code of this component may be 
based on the open source project OPC Client 

12

Next the component uses the IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace 
interface to enumerate all OPC items on the server  Specifically, it looks for 
items that contain the following strings in their name:
•  ctlSelOn
•  ctlOperOn
•  ctlSelOff
•  ctlOperOff
•  \Pos and stVal
The names of these items may suggest that attackers are interested in 
OPC items provided by OPC servers that belong to solutions from ABB, 
such as their MicroSCADA range  Figure 15 demonstrates an example list of 
OPC items that contain names with similar strings  This list of OPC items is 
received by the OPC Process Objects List Tool from ABB 

Figure 14  The PE export reveals the internal DLL name of the OPC DA payload 

The OPC DA payload does not require any kind of configuration file  
Once executed by the attacker, it enumerates all OPC servers using the 
ICatInformation::EnumClassesOfCategories method with CATID_
OPCDAServer20 category identifier and IOPCServer::GetStatus to 
identify the ones running 

Figure 15  An example of OPC items names in IN field received using  

OPC Process Objects List Tool 

Win32/IndustroyerThe attackers use the string Abdul when they add a new OPC group  
Possibly this string is used by the attackers as a slang term when referring 
to the ABB solutions 

Figure 16  The disassembled code of the OPC DA component that uses the Abdul string 

On the final step, the OPC DA payload attempts to change the state of 
discovered OPC items using the IOPCSyncIO interface by writing the 0x01 
value twice 

Figure 17  Disassembled code of OPC DA payload that uses IOPCSyncIO interface 

13

The component writes the OPC server name, OPC item name state, quality 
code and value to the log file  The logged values are separated with the 
following headers:
•  [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: Before]
•  [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: After ON]
•  [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: After OFF]

Data wiper component
The data wiper component is a destructive  module that is used in the final 
stage of an attack  The attackers are using this component to hide their 
tracks and to make recovery difficult 
This component has the filename haslo.dat or haslo.exe and can 
be executed by the Launcher component or used as a standalone 
malicious tool 
Once executed it attempts to enumerate all keys in the registry that list 
Windows services:
•  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
It attempts to set the registry value ImagePath with an empty string in 
each of the entries found  This operation will make the operating system 
unbootable 
The next step is actual deletion of file contents  The component 
enumerates files with specific file extensions on all drives connected to 
computer, from C:\ to Z:\  It should be noted that during enumeration 
the component skips files that are located in subdirectory that contains 
Windows in its name 
The component rewrites file content with meaningless data obtained from 
newly allocated memory  In order to perform this operation thoroughly the 
component attempts to rewrite files twice  The first attempt happens once 
the file is found on a drive  If the first attempt is unsuccessful then the wiper 
malware makes a second attempt, but before that the malware terminates 

Win32/Industroyerall processes except those included in a list of critical system processes  The 
list of these processes is displayed in Figure 18 
To speed up the wiping operation this component rewrites only partial file 
content at the beginning of the file  The amount of data to be rewritten 
depends on file size: the smallest amount of data will be rewritten for files 
less than or equal to 1Mb (4096 bytes); the largest amount of data will be 
rewritten for files less than or equal to 10Mb (32768 bytes) 
Finally, this component attempts to terminate all processes (including 
system processes) except its own  This will result in the system becoming 
unresponsive and eventually crashing 

Figure 18  List of processes that are not terminated on second rewriting attempt 

The filename masks targeted by the data wiper component to be 
overwritten are:

SYS_BASCON COM
* v
* PL
* paf
* XRF
* trc

* pcmi
* pcmt
* ini
* xml
* CIN
* prj

* SCL
* bak
* cid
* scd
* pcmp

* cxm
* elb
* epl
* mdf
* ldf

* 7z
* exe
* dll

This list contains filename extensions that are used in a standard 
environment, such as Windows binaries ( exe/ dll), archives ( 7z / tar/ rar/ 
zip), backup files ( bak/ bk/ bkp), Microsoft SQL server files ( mdf/ ldf), 
and various configuration files ( ini/ xml)  In addition, the component also 
wipes files that may be used in industrial control systems, such as files 
written using Substation Configuration description Language ( scl/ cid/ scd) and 
there are many files and file extensions that are used by various products 
from ABB  For example, a file named SYS_BASCON.COM is used by ABB 
solutions for storing configuration data, and files with the .paf‌(Product‌
Authorization‌File) filename extension are used to store license data 
for ABB MicroSCADA products 

Additional tools: port scanner tool
The attackers’ arsenal includes a port scanner that can be used to map 
the network and to find computers relevant to their attack  Interestingly, 
instead of using software already existing, the attackers built their own 
custom-made port scanner  As is evident from Figure 19, the attacker can 
define a range of IP addresses and a range of network ports that are to be 
scanned by this tool

Additional tools: DoS tool
Another tool from the attackers’ arsenal is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) tool 
that can be used against Siemens SIPROTEC devices  This tool leverages 
the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in order to render a device unresponsive  
Once this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the target device stops 
responding to any commands until it is rebooted manually 
To exploit this vulnerability the attackers hardcoded the device IP addresses 
into this tool  Once the tool is executed it sends specifically crafted packets 
to port 50,000 of the target IP addresses using UDP  The UDP packet 
contains only 18 bytes

Conclusion
The investigation behind the Ukrainian power outage last December is still 
ongoing and it is currently not confirmed that the malware analyzed here 
was the direct cause  Nevertheless, we believe that to be a very probable 
explanation, as the malware is able to directly control switches and circuit 
breakers at power grid substations using four ICS protocols and contains an 
activation timestamp for December 17, 2016, the day of the power outage 
We can definitely say that the Win32/Industroyer malware family is an 
advanced and sophisticated piece of malware that is used against industrial 
control systems  However, it should be noted that the malware itself is just 
a tool in the hands of an even more advanced and very capable malicious 
actor  Using logs produced by the toolset and highly configurable payloads, 
the attackers could adapt the malware to any comparable environment 

The commonly-used industrial control protocols used in this malware 
were designed decades ago without taking security into consideration  
Therefore, any intrusion into an industrial network with systems using 
these protocols should be considered as “game over”
