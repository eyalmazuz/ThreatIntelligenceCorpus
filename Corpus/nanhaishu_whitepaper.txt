NANHAISHU

RATing the South China Sea

TLP: White

SUMMARY 
This whitepaper details a malicious program we identify as NanHaiShu. Based on our analysis, the threat 
actor behind this malware targets government and private-sector organizations. Notable targets of 
the malware include the Department of Justice of the Philippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit and a major international law firm.

We believe these entities were targeted for their involvement in a dispute centering on the South China 
Sea. The conflicting territorial claims at the heart of the issue were addressed by an international tribunal 
on 12th July 2016[1]. Based on the specific selection of organizations targeted for attack by this malware, as 
well as indications revealed in our technical analysis of the malware itself, we believe the threat actor to 
be of Chinese origin. 

We saw the first sample of NanHaiShu in the wild for the last couple years, and as of March 2016, it is still 
being actively distributed. Technically speaking, the malware is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is 
spread in spearphishing email messages which contain the malware as a malicious file attachment. The 
contents of the email message include, among other things, industry-specific terms that indicate they 
were deliberately designed with the specific targets in mind.

The attached file contains a VBA macro that executes an embedded JScript file. It is likely that the threat 
actor knew the targets use VBA macros in their business environment, since the attack only works if the 
default security setting in Microsoft Office is modified to allow macro execution. 

Once installed on a machine in the target network, NanHaiShu sends information from the infected 
machine to a remote command and control (C&C) server.

NANHAISHU RATing the South China SeaINTELLIGENCE

ATTACK OVERVIEW 

Infection vector
The threat actor uses spearphishing email messages to 
deliver the malware to their targets, with the text contents 
of the emails carefully crafted (or ‘socially engineered’) 
to the recipients. For example, the content of the email 
messages used to target the law firm included text related 
to salary or financial matters (Image 1). 

The care displayed in crafting the contents of the 
spearphishing emails indicates the level of effort made by 
the threat actor to convince recipients that the emails were 
legitimate.

Target details
The common denominator among the targets selected 
is that they have some relation to the territorial dispute 
revolving around the South China Sea.

Targets included the Department of Justice of the 
Philippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Summit and an international law firm 
representing one of the involved parties.

Philippines Department of Justice
The Department of Justice of the Philippines has been 
involved in the arbitration case filed by that country against 
China[2].

APEC organizers
A sample we recently encountered used a theme related 
to the Economic Leader’s Meeting (AELM), an event tied 
to the APEC Summit that was held in the Philippines in 
November 2015[3]. In the leadup to the event,news reports 
had indicated that the South China Sea dispute was 
expected to be tabled and addressed by the ministers[4,5]. 

Major international law firm
This major international law firm represents nation states in 
arbitration cases involving the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea. Since 2013, this firm has been 
representing one of the parties in its dispute[6].  

 
Prior to publication, we made an attempt to reach out to 
the organizations that we identified as targets and notified 
them of this threat. Per request, some details have been 
withheld from inclusion in this public report.

RATing the South China Sea NANHAISHUTIMELINE

Multiple NanHaiShu samples were discovered over the 
course of the investigation. Of the samples collected, a 
particular subset was tasked with gathering intelligence 
related to the South China Sea arbitration case.

Distribution of this subset of samples started from January 
13th 2015. The file “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.
xls” was seen just a month after the Permanent Court 
of Arbitration posted a third press release about the 
arbitration case between the two countries[7]. 

The press release announced that the Philippines 
(represented by the law firm) had until March 15th 2015 
to submit supplemental arguments on their case, while 
China had until June 16th 2015 to provide a response to the 
submission.

Two attacks happened between the two aforementioned 
deadlines:

 y After the Philippines’ deadline, a document file 

with a filename that referenced the company 
name was sent to the law firm. 

 y Another file that also targeted the lawyers used 

the name “Salary and Bonus Data.xls” and was 
released on May 22th 2015, or barely a month 
before China’s deadline. 

We saw another sample of this threat also being 
distributed using a file named “AELM Entertainment 
budget and Attendance allowance.xls”. 

This file was seen in the wild on October 2nd 2015, more 
than a month prior to the actual event in the Philippines. 
The event was attended by, among others, Chinese 
President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama; one 
of the main topics that was expected to be tabled during 
the event was the South China Sea dispute[4,5].

On October 26th 2015, there were multiple news reports 
about the movement of US military ships in the South 
China Sea[8,9]. In the exact same time frame, there was 
a notable change in the C&C servers contacted by the 
malware (see Attribution & Links section).

IMAGE 3: CODE COMPARISON

ATTRIBUTION & LINKS

The malware’s VBA base64 decoder function seems to 
be popular among Chinese programmers - searching for 
the variable names on the Internet leads to a handful of 
Chinese websites (Image 2). 

The variables initialization used by the VBA malware script 
appears to be a forked version of the Javascript base64 
decoder. This latter code was publicly available in a blog 
post from the Chinese Software Developer Network 
(CSDN) website (Image 3), as early as 2005. 

NanHaiShu samples initially had most of their C&C 
servers resolve to IP addresses hosted in the United States 
(specifically, to cloud computing service providers). 
On October 26th 2015 however, all of the malware’s C&C 
servers pointed to the IP address 103.238.224.218 (Image 
4), an IP hosted from a Chinese AS, coinciding with news 
reports of US ship movements in the South China Sea [8,9].

Our technical analysis indicates a notable orientation 
towards code and infrastructure associated with 
developers in mainland China. In addition, we also 
consider it significant that the selection of organizations 
targeted for infiltration are directly relevant to topics that 
are considered to be of strategic national interest to the 
Chinese government. Based on these points, we believe 
that the threat actor is of Chinese origin.

CONSEQUENCES 

NanHaiShu is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and thus 
is able to send system information from an infected 
machine to a remote C&C server. It is capable of receiving 
and executing additional JScript and VBScript code. The 
RAT can also download any file the attacker pleases. 
The downloaded files or scripts may then be used for 
exfiltration of data that is likely to be highly sensitive, 
given the profile of its targets.

RATing the South China Sea NANHAISHUTECHNICAL ANALYSIS

INFECTION SEQUENCE

NanHaiShu arrives via a spearphishing email message with a file attachment. The emails are sent out from free email 
service providers and as with most such messages, use socially engineered text content to entice the user into opening 
the attachment. The file is usually an XLS, but may also be a DOC file. Regardless of format, the attached document 
contains a malicious macro. 

In most major business environments today, the ability to run macros is disabled by default in the security settings for 
Microsoft Office programs. If this setting has been modified however, or if the individual user is permitted to enable 
macros, it is still possible for macro code to be launched. 

Office will display a notification message before the macro code can be executed:

IMAGE 5: MACRO SECURITY WARNING

 

 
The user must actively enable the macros in the document for the attack to continue. If the user unwittingly does so, the 
VBA macro decodes and runs.

IMAGE 6: VBA MACRO DECODES AND EXECUTES THE JSCRIPT

6

NANHAISHU RATing the South China SeaIn most of the samples, two sets of Base64 encoded files are embedded in the VBA macro. For the recent sample, the VBA 
macro will decode and first write JScript data to “%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js”, then execute it. 

IMAGE 7: VBA MACRO DECODES & OPENS DECOY XLS FILE

The macro then decodes a decoy XLS file, which it saves to the current directory using the same filename as the malicious 
XLS. The decoy is then loaded. Finally, the macro creates a VBScript file that will delete the original file.

Meanwhile, the network.js modifies the %regrun% registry to point to itself as its autostart mechanism.

The code will proceed to retrieve the following system information (Image 8, next page) and upload it to the C&C server:

1.   Volume Serial Number
2.   IP Address
3.   Computer Name
4.   User Name
5.   Operating System
6.   Proxy Server

 

Afterwards, it waits for instructions from the server for a maximum interval of 10.584 seconds (or 6 * 0x6e4 ms).

NANHAISHU RATing the South China SeaOBFUSCATION

The VBA macro uses base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file. For the recent sample, the URL string used 
inside the JScript code was obfuscated in two layers; it had to be decoded using base64, then decrypted using a routine 
that extracts and converts a Unicode number to a character.  

 

IMAGE 9: ADDITIONAL OBFUSCATION ON TOP OF BASE64 ENCODING

NETWORK TRAFFIC

The attackers utilize dynamic DNS providers for their C&C server; the server that the malware contacts is already included 
the malicious JScript code. For the most recent sample, the communication between the malware and C&C server uses 
this data structure before encoding:

md5(Volume Serial Number) | IP Address | Computer Name | User Name | Operating System | Proxy Server | Malware Version |

Below is the POST data example from an infected VM image:  

action=aaa&data=N2RkZjMyZTE3YTZhYzVjZTA0YThlY2JmNzgyY2E1MDl8MTkyLjE2OC4xLjF8Sm9obkRvZS1QQ3xKb2huRG

0saW1wdCxwcnw=

The malware uses HTTP POST to upload the encoded system information and uses HTTP GET to download and execute 
JScript and VBScript code.

RATing the South China Sea NANHAISHUOTHER NOTES

The JScript contains a constant variable named “gVersion”. The variable  seems to be the malware name/version used by 
the threat actor to identify the source of data. 

The variable “gVersion” contained variations of the following strings:

1.   hta[1.1]doj.m
2.   jsne[1.3.3]PP
3.   jsne[1.4],impt,pr

 

IMAGE 11: GVERSION VARIABLE

The gVersion of the recent JScript is “jsne[1.4],impt,pr”.

The HTA file dropped by the “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xls” sample has the same JScript routines that exists in later 
samples, but they are encapsulated inside an HTML format. The file is loaded using the MSHTA.EXE program, which opens 
up the Internet Explorer. Compared with HTML, the HTA has more privileges that can create, edit and remove files and 
registry entries[10]. 

IMAGE 12: HTML TAGS ENCAPSULATING THE MALWARE CODE

10

NANHAISHU RATing the South China SeaThe first SCRIPT tag moves the IE window outside the viewable area and hides it using the resizeTo command. The second 
SCRIPT tag contains the JScript routine that are common among NanHaiShu samples. 

The only difference between the HTA and the JScript files is that the C&C is not encrypted and it contains the SafeIE 
function, which modifies the “Internet Settings” and “Internet Explorer” registries to avoid any prompt related to running 
unsafe ActiveX.
