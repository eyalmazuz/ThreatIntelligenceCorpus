EP13 Show Notes: 
Struts - when to patch and when to patch with a vengeance. In light of the Equifax breach, we discuss how patching can make you live better days, Never look back and say, Could have been me.  Naturally, that convo leads into the biggest story of the week around Pwning the Supply Chain - CCleaner, Python, and Nyetya style.  Avast made some mistakes, but every tech company is susceptible to supply chain attacks.  What can companies do to protect themselves and how can users adopt a stronger security posture in this area? We also talk Ex$ploit Economy - Valuing exploits by supply and demand. Zerodium has an extensive price list, what can we discern about the availability and difficulty of various exploits using basic economics?
