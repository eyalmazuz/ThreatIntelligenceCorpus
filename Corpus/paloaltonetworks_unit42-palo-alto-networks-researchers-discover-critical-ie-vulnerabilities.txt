Palo Alto Networks Researchers Discover Critical IE Vulnerabilities

Palo Alto Networks researchers Tongbo Luo and Hui Gao were credited with the discoveries of new critical Microsoft vulnerabilities affecting Internet Explorer (IE) versions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on affected Windows clients. These vulnerabilities are documented in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-106 and MS15-112.
In our continued commitment to the security research community, these vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft through our participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) program, which ensures the timely, responsible disclosure of new vulnerabilities and creation of protections from security vendors.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research and has discovered more than 90 critical vulnerabilities over the past two years. By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers to compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
