BadPatch

Introduction
In April 2017, in collaboration with Clearsky, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 published an article about our research into targeted attacks in the Middle East. In that research we discussed two new malware families we named KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA.
Since then, we have continued our research into the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure associated with KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. This ongoing research lead us to a new Middle Eastern campaign. Our findings from this new campaign include C2 infrastructure, new attack methods, four types of malware (including Android malware), a system for management of stolen victim data and some detail of the actors.
It is notable that our research has shown that this newly-identified attack campaign dates back to at least June 2012, over five years ago.
In this blog, we outline the results of our research into this new campaign so far.
 
Finding the New Campaign
Our discovery of this new campaign begins where our previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research left off.
Pivoting from Previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA Research
One of the C2 servers we observed in our earlier KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research was mailsinfo[.]com. The first IP address that this domain resolved to from about mid-May 2015 through October-November 2015 was 148.251.135[.]117.
We used passive DNS (pDNS) and found the server mail.pal4u[.]net on 148.251.135[.]117 starting mid-May 2015. We also found other servers on this IP address. We do not believe this necessarily gives a link between campaigns found on this IP address as it appears to be shared by multiple unrelated third parties. However, the nature of activity and some malware artifacts on this IP address does suggest a possible link to the Gaza Hackers group.
 
C2 Infrastructure
As we followed our leads from the previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research and dug into the server mail.pal4u[.]net on 148.251.135[.]117 that research led us to find the C2 infrastructure of this new campaign.
Digging into Pal4u
The WHOIS for pal4u[.]net appears to be a Palestinian hosting company. The DNS records for pal4u[.]net gives us, in addition to the “WWW” hostname, the Name Servers (NS) “NS1” and “NS2” and additional IP address 195.154.216[.]74.
We found six additional domains that used palu4u[.]net as NS, and which all shared the same historic IP address 195.154.216[.]74 (Figure 2). From the seven total domains, we observed six as malware Command & Control (C2), exfiltration, malware download servers, and/or in associated malware code:
Pal4u[.]net
Pal2me[.]net
Pay2earn[.]net
Shop8d[.]net
Ts4shope[.]net
pal4news[.]net
We only found one of the seven domains associated with this IP, ads4market[.]net, not associated with malware activity. We did not find any legitimate activity or content associated with these six domains during the period of associated registration.

Figure 1- C2 domain links
While there is historic WHOIS for pal2me[.]net and shop8d[.]net, research into the registrant information suggests this is related to the ISP rather than the actors using the site for C2.
We also found the DNS RNAME “a.faris.live[.]com” was used, but this also seems to be related to the host ISP rather than the site owner.
Understanding that we were looking at a collection of linked malware C2 servers, we started to look into the attacks methods and malware that used this infrastructure.
 
Attack Methods
We observed initial attacks using this infrastructure were against victims via spear phishing. However, for the first time in any known Gaza Hackers-linked campaign, we also found a limited use of vulnerability exploits – RTF exploit CVE-2012-0158 documented by Citizenlab (Part 3 – “The Curious Case of the Shared Exploit”). The attackers used the RTF exploit to download their “BadPatch” Windows malware from hacked WordPress site wp.piedslibres[.]com/wp/wp-includes/js/Next.scr.

In most of the attacks we observed the malware will display a blank Microsoft Word decoy file, or a Microsoft Word file with error message:
“An error occurred, please try your request again later“.
We did observe some variations in this attack. The first malware sample that we identified (compiled on 12 June 2012) dropped an Adobe Flash decoy file (Figure 2):

Malware Analysis
We collected 148 malware samples in this campaign, using the C2 servers that we identified, and grouped them into four categories:

Microsoft Visual Basic Malware – exfiltrates data via SMTP (port 26), and HTTP.
Autoit malware – early versions also used SMTP for exfiltration, but mainly HTTP.
Autoit downloader & dropper (downloads and executes the Autoit malware)
Android malware – exfiltration via HTTP (first seen December 2015)

Microsoft Visual Basic malware
Upon infection the malware copies itself to %appdata%\microsoft\microsoft [0-9]{9-15}\dwm.exe (9-15 digits in directory name “Microsoft”), and adds a link to the malware executable in the startup folder for persistence.
These variants include system information collection (operating system, computer name), keylogger output, and browser password collection from Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox.
Keylogger and system info exfiltration is done via HTTP Post:
lms/getdata.php?myAction=add_line&macName=…$&computer_id=App.EXEName&mac_address=…&dns_domain=nnn&domain=bbb&content2=$FRESH:%20%20ESC%20pango2012ENTR&ver=3&mac_time=tt&patch_user_id=mgh2&patch_group_id=Label1(2).Caption
File exfiltration is done via SMTP port 26, with the SMTP credentials hardcoded encrypted in the malware code. Some mailbox examples:
user: sender_b@pal4u[.]net
 password: sender@123
ubuntu_net@pal4u[.]net
ubuntu_send@pal4u[.]net

Figure 3- SMTP encryption settings
The list of files for exfiltration are written to the malware folder as “sysfiles.txt”. A file “1.done” is generated with content “done” after successful exfiltration. The file “mac.txt” contains the computer MAC address. Some versions exfiltrate recent files, others collect and exfiltrate files matching a hardcoded extension list:
*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pdf;*.mdb;*.rar;*.zip*.doc;*.docx
AutoIt Malware
We observed a shift from Visual Basic to  AutoIt malware in this campaign around March 2016. AutoIt is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general-purpose scripting.
This malware achieves persistence by writing to “%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Microsoft.lnk” using the WScript object.
It attempts to detect if it is being run in a Virtual Machine (VM) using a WMI query for disk drive name, BIOS, and motherboard:

Checks for processes “VBoxService.exe”, “VBoxTray.exe”, “VMwareTray.exe”
WMI query on Win32_DiskDrive, looking for “VBOX HARDDISK”,”QEMU HARDDISK”,”VMWARE VIRTUAL IDE HARD DRIVE”, “VMware Virtual S SCSI Disk Device”
WMI query on Win32_BIOS “Found Vbox BIOS version”
WMI query on Win32_Baseboard “Found VMware-style motherboard”, “440BX Desktop Reference Platform”. Name=”Base Board”

The malware deletes Chrome and Firefox cached password files, requiring the user to re-enter site passwords, affording the keylogger the opportunity to capture them.
The malware can be instructed to kill the malware process by Process ID, or by hardcoded name.
It can update itself by downloading and executing a newer version:
h__p://m103.pay2earn[.]net/public/versions/[“svchost” & $i & “.zip] (where i=1 to 7).
The new version is saved at %appdata%\Microsoft\updte\svchost.scr.
Environment data exfiltration via POST
It will perform a WMI query to enumerate installed security products.
It stores data in log files:
Specific attacker username stored at %appdata%\Microsoft\updte\usu.log
MAC address %appdata%\Microsoft\updte\mac.log
Errors are logged at  %appdata%\Microsoft\updte\log.log
This data is exfiltrated along with Operating System version and architecture using HTTP POST:
h__p://m103.pay2earn[.]net/devices/settings
/devices/settings?mac_address=<macAddress>&content=%20Start%20Downloader%20majdTest%201/2017Anti%20Type:%20%20%20OS%20Version%20=%20WIN_7%20|%20X64
h__p://m103.pay2earn[.]net/logs/new
/logs/new?name=<computerName>$&computer_id=App.EXEName&mac_address=<macAddress>&content=$%20Start%20Downloader%20%20majdTest%201/2017&patch_username=majd
Screenshots via SMTP
The malware takes screenshots on the victim computer, exfiltrating them using SMTP (port 26) as “GDIPlus_Image1.jpg” and “GDIPlus_Image2.jpg”.
The SMTP configuration is saved as encrypted RC4 strings, decrypted with password !@#$%^&*()
 

Figure 4- SMTP RC4 encrypted strings init
Mail is sent, in this example, using the string “Start Downloader majdTest 1/2017”.
 

Figure 5- SMTP mail sending function
The emails are sent from an email address at the C2 server, to a recipient address on the same server. Decrypted example:
smtpserver:  m103.pay2earn[.]net
fromname:    sn@m103.pay2earn[.]net
fromaddress: sn@m103.pay2earn[.]net
toaddress:   asf@m103.pay2earn[.]net
username:    sn@m103.pay2earn[.]net
password:    sn_$_2016
We observed a single variant using an obfuscated AutoIt script (5c6e531738c1380ec09c1ec0f1438cee5077e6cbade8af87710b8be2f0aaaac7). Another outlier variant was keylogger-only, supporting intercepting only Arabic and English characters (42adec426addf3fd0c6aff406b46fa82d901f5a9bed7758a243458961349a362).
Autoit downloader / dropper
This simple component downloads and executes malware from the C2 server (e.g. pal4u[.]net or m103.pay2earn[.]net).

Android Malware
The actors do not miss the opportunity to also collect data from the Android devices of their targets.
As well as the typical ability to update the malware, this Android malware collects and exfiltrates device files, SMS messages, voice calls, and can also be used to remotely record sound or video using the device. A follow-up blog will examine this malware in detail.
 
Records Management System and Victims
The threat actors have developed their own, custom system to manage the data exfiltrated by their victims, “نظام إدارة السجلات” (“Records Management System”). Server logon requires 2-Factor authentication (2FA).


Figure 7- RMS SMS 2FA
Figure 6- RMS Logon Screen
During the course of our research, we observed a newly introduced bug in their authentication. Navigating directly to the page “sms.php” bypassed the initial password entry requirement, taking us directly to the SMS verification page (Figure 6).
Further, we discovered that navigating directly to “/lms/index.php” no longer redirects the user to login.php, but instead granted authenticated access to the system.
 

Figure 8- Records Management System
This allowed us to enumerate the victims contacting the exfiltration server (Figure 9,) through March 2016.
 

Figure 9- Victims by country
As reflects the nature of campaign, we notice a small overall number of victims. That the majority of victims appear domestic is also not unusual in such campaigns, although we also noted the actor infecting their own test machines in some cases (Figure 10).

Figure 10- Testing Logs
 
The Adversary
We find some hints in sample filenames, Microsoft Visual Project directory names, and HTTP POST parameters, suggesting the names of some of the actors involved in this campaign, and a possible link to an official Gaza Bureau.
S:\sh\work files from shaaban\4shopfiles tajas\shop8d\Project1.vbp
C:\Documents and Settings\HADJYOUB.HADJ-1065B94515\Bureau\cm\Project1.vbp
Possible nickname strings that we observed include:
Shaaban, Hadjyoub, OMR, mgh2, rashed, Shady, majd , f2b, jno, ajr , hmg, vip, 2ta, asf, h2m, mag

Naming
The actors appear to name this malware “Patch”:
“\2014-03-17\exe\gaza\Project1.vbp”
 V:\Batch Versions\
In Arabic, “P” and “B” are phonetically similar, leading to common B/P misspellings.
Embedded strings:
“Old – update patch and check anti-virus.. ”
“PatchNotExit– Check Version”
“PatchNotExit– download now”
“PatchNotExit– Version Patch“
Server communication parameters:
lms/getdata.php?myAction=add_line&macName=…$&computer_id=App.EXEName&mac_address=…&dns_domain=nnn&domain=bbb&content2=$FRESH:%20%20ESC%20pango2012ENTR&ver=3&mac_time=tt&patch_user_id=mgh2&patch_group_id=Label1(2).Caption
The “patch_user_id” parameter appears to refer to the individual actor managing this victim.
 

Age of Campaign
The oldest sample we observed has a compile date of 12 June 2012. The C2 server linked to that sample, pal2me[.]net, was also first registered on the same date. This campaign has been running for at least more than five years, and continues to this date.

Conclusion
Diligence in investigating infrastructure associated with a previously documented campaign, led us to another possibly unrelated campaign, crossing paths in hosting.
This allowed us to uncover a previously unknown C2 and exfiltration infrastructure, associated malware, and the first time that we’ve observed this group using exploits.
The simplicity of the malware and relative unsophistication of C2, exfiltration and stolen data management belies the demonstrated fact that this very targeted, low-volume campaign has been working fine for these actors for five years, and continues today.
