MS14-063 A Potential XP Exploit


This post was written by Marcin Noga with contributions by Earl Carter and Martin Lee.


New vulnerabilities for old operating systems may not seem particularly interesting, until you consider the large number of legacy machines running outdated versions of Windows. Windows XP has reached its end of life, meaning that new vulnerabilities will not be patched. In this post we will show that a recent vulnerability can be used as a platform for exploiting Windows XP.

In October, Microsoft released a bulletin for a privilege escalation vulnerability in the FASTFAT driver that was released as:

MS14-063 -- Vulnerability in FAT32 Disk Partition Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2998579),  CVE-2014-4115.

Let me present some of the most interesting parts of the advisory and add some details from my own research.


When the bug kicks in…

In the advisory, Microsoft indicates that the following OS’s are vulnerable:


Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2
Vista SP2
Server 2008 SP2


The Microsoft bulletin does not mention Windows XP, since Windows XP is no longer supported. According to my research, however, this vulnerability is also present in the Windows XP FASTFAT driver.

See the following video.

This vulnerability can be exploited on Windows XP SP3 using a malicious usb stick with a malformed FAT32 partition. Let’s examine the reaction when the USB is inserted into the system.


General Description

Vulnerable code existing in the FastFAT.sys driver can be exploited via an intentionally malformed FAT32 Boot sector delivered through a USB flash drive. If the field “Number of FATs” contains a value greater than 2, the driver will allocate insufficient memory. Further actions made by FastFAT.sys driver will then cause a pool overflow.


How it happens -- code analysis

The following is an example of a malformed FAT32 Boot Sector. The “Number of FATs” field is set to 119 (0x77 in hex), instead of the normal value of 2, making the boot sector malformed.

Memory corruption is a common driver problem. Activation of a special pool will help us to locate the moment when a pool overflow starts to appear

verifier /volatile /flags 0x1 /adddriver fastfat.sys

After insertion of USB flash drive with a malformed FAT32 we can examine the crash dump that occurs due to insufficient memory allocation.

Detailed analysis

To help debug driver memory issues, you can enable the special pool feature. This feature causes each memory allocation to be placed on a separate page. With the special pool active for fastfat.sys, you should begin executing the following when the overflow occurs,:
PAGE:0001C37A     movzx edx, word ptr [eax+90h]
PAGE:0001C381     movzx ecx, cx
PAGE:0001C384     imul    edx, ecx
PAGE:0001C387     mov     [ebp+BytesPerFat], edx
PAGE:0001C38D
PAGE:0001C38D loc_1C38D:
PAGE:0001C38D     mov     cl, [eax+96h]
PAGE:0001C393     cmp     cl, 2     ; cl = Number of FATs
PAGE:0001C396     jbe     short RegularFATsAmount
PAGE:0001C398     push    'itaF'     ; Tag
PAGE:0001C39D     movzx eax, cl
PAGE:0001C3A0     push    eax     ; Number of FATs used as pool size
PAGE:0001C3A1     push    11h     ; PoolType
PAGE:0001C3A3     call ds:__imp__ExAllocatePoolWithTag
PAGE:0001C3A9     mov     edi, eax
PAGE:0001C3AB     mov     eax, [ebp+VCB]
PAGE:0001C3AE     jmp     short loc_1C3B6

PAGE:0001C3B0
PAGE:0001C3B0 RegularFATsAmount:
PAGE:0001C3B0     lea     edi, [ebp+var_174]
PAGE:0001C3B6
PAGE:0001C3B6 loc_1C3B6:
PAGE:0001C3B6     mov [ebp+unknow], edi
PAGE:0001C3BC     and     [ebp+counter], 0
PAGE:0001C3C3     cmp     byte ptr [eax+96h], 0

PAGE:0001C3D1     sub     edx, [ebp+StartingVbo]

PAGE:0001C3D7 fillArrayLoop:
PAGE:0001C3D7     mov edi, [ebp+offsetToFirstFAT]
PAGE:0001C3DA     mov     [eax-4], edi
PAGE:0001C3DD     mov     [eax-0Ch], ecx
PAGE:0001C3E0     and     dword ptr [eax-8], 0
PAGE:0001C3E4     mov     [eax], edx
PAGE:0001C3E6     mov     edi, [ebp+unknow3]
PAGE:0001C3EC     mov     [eax+4], edi
PAGE:0001C3EF     inc     [ebp+counter]
PAGE:0001C3F5     add     ecx, [ebp+BytesPerFat]
PAGE:0001C3FB     add     eax, 18h
PAGE:0001C3FE     mov     edi, [ebp+VCB]
PAGE:0001C401     movzx edi, byte ptr [edi+96h] ; to EDI goes Number of FATs
PAGE:0001C408     cmp     [ebp+counter], edi
PAGE:0001C40E     jb short fillArrayLoop

Note:  When the number of FATs is bigger than 2, the pool allocated is simply the number of FATs (instead of the number of FATs times size of a FAT entry)

PAGE:0001C39D     movzx eax, cl
PAGE:0001C3A0     push    eax     ; Number of FATs used as pool size
PAGE:0001C3A1     push    11h     ; PoolType
PAGE:0001C3A3     call    ds:__imp__ExAllocatePoolWithTag


The Next loop appears and it iterates the number of times indicated by the number of FATs. In this loop, labeled as fillArrayLoop, the pool allocated by the code describe above is filled by an array of structures where the size of the structure equals 24 bytes (each structure consists of 6 DWORD’s). It Is easy to deduce that the iteration will lead to a pool overflow because during the pool allocation, the number of FATs was taken into account without including the size of structure element. It’s even easier to understand on pseudo code:

NumberOfFATs = *(_BYTE *)(VCB + 150);
 if ( NumberOfFATs <= 2u )
 {
 ptrPool = &v100;
 }
 else
 {
 ptrPool = ExAllocatePoolWithTag((POOL_TYPE)17, NumberOfFATs, 'itaF'); 
[BUG]//NumberOfFATs !!! instead of NumberOfFATs * sizeof(SomeStructure)=24
 v14 = VCB;
 }
 counter = 0;
 if ( *(_BYTE *)(v14 + 0x96) )
 {
 v18 = offsetToFirstFAT;
 unknow1 = offsetToFirstFAT - unknow2;
 v20 = (int)((char *)ptrPool + 12);
 do
 {
 *(_DWORD *)(v20 - 4) = offsetToFirstFAT;
 *(_DWORD *)(v20 - 12) = v18;
 *(_DWORD *)(v20 - 8) = 0;
 *(_DWORD *)v20 = unknow1;
 *(_DWORD *)(v20 + 4) = unknow3;
 ++counter;
 v18 += BytesPerFat;
 v20 += 24;
 }
 while ( counter < NumberOfFATs );
 }


Exploitability

After three iterations of the loop cycle, here is how this array looks in memory:
#1
00 48 00 00
00 00 00 00
00 48 00 00
00 08 00 00
00 02 00 00
ef ef ef ef <- not initialized
#2
00 1c 05 00
00 00 00 00
00 48 00 00
00 08 00 00
00 02 00 00
ef ef ef ef <- not initialized
#3
00 f0 09 00
00 00 00 00
00 48 00 00
00 08 00 00
00 02 00 00
ef ef ef ef <- not initialized


Which values at a particular offset are we able to control ?

Offset +0: (v20 - 12)

For the first iteration it’s value equals offsetToFirstFAT and is the result of adding:

(v20 - 12) = (v20 - 12) + BytesPerFat.

Note: BytesPerFAT equals : Bytes per sector(= 512) * Sectors per fat(= 618)  == 0x4D400

(316416)

Offset +4: (v20 - 8)

Constant 0

Offset + 8: (v20 - 4)
The value of this field always equals offsetToFirstFAT.

Note: offsetToFirstFAT : Bytes per sector * Reserved sectors == (0x4800)



Taking into account the information about how this bug is triggered and what portion of data we are able to control during page overflow this vulnerability appears to be hard to exploit. The most lucrative scenario for attacker would be to create a malformed FAT32 partition (that does not cause crashes after usb stick insertion) which contains an executable file with the possibility for the victim to run it.

When run, this executable, for example, would be responsible for kernel pool spraying. After that it would write any random data to the malformed partition, triggering at the same time the bug in FatCommonWrite. My observations show that when you create a nearly empty malformed partition containing a couple files, the bug only triggers when you open one of these files and try to save (write) modifications.

Even though this vulnerability seems to be hard to exploit, we should not disregard this vulnerability because history and recently Chris Evans’ write-up about off-by-one shows that any kind of scenario can become real in some circumstances.


Conclusion

This vulnerability is obviously a serious issue for users who are still running Windows XP. Unfortunately, due to Windows XP being no longer being supported, the vulnerability is not going to be patched. Therefore, users will need to upgrade to a newer version of Windows to be safe from this particular vulnerability.
