Unit 42 Finds New Mirai and Gafgyt IoT/Linux Botnet Campaigns

The end of May 2018 has marked the emergence of three malware campaigns built on publicly available source code for the Mirai and Gafgyt malware families that incorporate multiple known exploits affecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Samples belonging to these campaigns incorporate as many as eleven exploits within a single sample, beating the IoT Reaper malware, which borrowed some of the Mirai source code but also came with an integrated LUA environment that incorporated nine exploits in its code.
In their newest evolution, samples also target the D-Link DSL-2750B OS Command Injection  vulnerability, only a few weeks after the publication of its Metasploit module on the 25th of May (even though the vulnerability has been public knowledge since February of 2016).
While exploring samples belonging to one of these campaigns, I also discovered they support several new DDoS methods previously unused by Mirai variants.
This blog post details each campaign (in the chronological order they were observed) along with the exploits used, the new DDoS methods supported, ending in a comparative summary of the campaigns.  Also covered is the tangential discovery of some Gafgyt samples incorporating new Layer 7 DDoS functionality targeting a known DDoS-protection provider.
IOCs for different campaigns, if not mentioned under the corresponding section, can be found at the end of this blog post.
 
CAMPAIGN 1: An evolution of Omni
In May 2018, the Omni botnet, a variant of Mirai, was found exploiting two vulnerabilities affecting Dasan GPON routers – CVE-2018-10561 (authentication bypass) and CVE-2018-1562 (command injection). The two vulnerabilities used in conjunction allow the execution of commands sent by an unauthenticated remote attacker to a vulnerable device.
Since then the same family has evolved to incorporate several more exploits, detailed in Table 1.
I used the sample below for this analysis

(Faulty exploit:
This vulnerability stems from the fact that anything trailing the last ‘/’ after the string “http://purenetworks.com/HNAP1/GetDeviceSettings” in the SoapAction header value is executed using the system command without sanitization
 
In this implementation, the exploit code is appended to “http://purenetworks.com/HNAP1/”, and hence the above condition will not be triggered. To the best of my knowledge this exploit will not work on any devices)

All of these vulnerabilities are publicly known and have been exploited by different botnets either separately or in combination with others in the past, however, this is the first Mirai variant using all eleven of them together.
Differentiating features of the campaign:

Two different encryption schemes: Aside from using the standard XOR encryption scheme seen in all Mirai variants, in this case using the table key 0xBAADF00D samples make use of a second key for the encryption of certain config strings.
Samples rely solely on exploits for propagation and don’t perform a credential brute-force attack.
Further infection of infected devices is prevented by dropping packets received on certain ports using iptables (Figure 1)

 

Figure 1: Screenshot from malware disassembly showing the use of iptables to drop future connection attempts via certain ports
The campaign makes use of the IP 213[.]183.53.120 both for serving payloads, and as a Command and Control (C2) server.
Pivoting off this IP, I discovered some Gafgyt samples that surfaced around the same time reporting to the same IP, but using a new method named ‘SendHTTPCloudflare‘. This method is detailed at the end of this blog post.
This campaign was linked to the Omni variant on several references in the code as seen such as the one seen in Figure 2 below.
 

Figure 2: OMNI reference in samples
 
The encrypted strings also reference a website gpon[.]party that was down at the time of this writing.

Figure 3: gpon[.]party reference
CAMPAIGN 2: Okane
Samples from this campaign were served from the IP 46[.]243.189.101. This host briefly had an open directory containing the samples, as seen in the figure below.

Figure 4: Screenshot from open directory at payload server 46[.]243.189.101
The payload source in this attack was located at hxxp://46[.]243.189.101/gang/. The downloaded payload is a shell script that attempts to replicate itself by downloading Okane binaries to vulnerable devices.  On the 13th of June, the payload source for some of these samples was briefly replaced with the Cloudflare DNS server 1[.]1.1.1.
This campaign incorporates the same exploits listed in Table 1. Figure 5 shows these exploits being called sequentially in one of the samples belonging to this campaign. Each call results in the creation of a dedicated fork for each exploit.

Figure 5: Screenshot from malware disassembly of exploit calls in a sample from Campaign 2
Unlike the previous campaign, these samples also perform a credential brute force attack. Some unusual entries were discovered on the brute force lists in these samples, such as the following:

root/t0talc0ntr0l4! – default credentials for Control4 devices
admin/adc123 – default credentials for ADC FlexWave Prism devices
mg3500/merlin – default credentials for Camtron IP cameras

Some samples belonging to this campaign include the addition of two new DDoS methods to the Mirai source code.
Below are descriptions of these new DDoS methods, extracted from the following sample.
 



SHA256
320ed65d955bdde8fb17a35024f7bd978d26c041de1ddcf8a592974f77d82401




attack_method_tcpxmas: involves sending TCP packets with all flags set, also known as Christmas tree packet This could be considered a more effective means of DDoS since these packets “require much more processing by routers and end-hosts than the “usual” packets do.” This method has already been observed used by Gafgyt and Kaiten variants in the past. The payload size of packets sent is set to 768 bytes.
attack_method_std: involves sending packets with a randomized payload of 1024 bytes.

 
Digging deeper reveals that samples using these attack methods have been part of a Mirai code fork from as early as August 2017.
Some newer samples from the same campaign also integrate additional methods that only appear in samples from the beginning of June 2018. Some notable methods are detailed below.
For this analysis I used a sample with the following hash.

attack_method_udpgame: UDP DDoS using SOCK_RAW from a random source port to the destination port 27015 (often used by online game servers).
attack_method_asyn: TCP DDoS using packets with random source and destination ports, using packets with the ACK and SYN flags set.
attack_method_tcpfrag: TCP DDoS using SOCK_RAW with random source and destination ports and sequence number, and flags URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN and FIN set. In this case the ‘Don’t Fragment’ bit is set to 1.
attack_method_tcpall: same as attack_method_tcpfrag above, except the ‘Don’t Fragment’ bit is set to 0.
attack_method_tcpusyn: TCP DDoS using packets with random source and destination ports, using packets with the URG and SYN flags set.

On the 19th of June, samples on this server were stripped of their exploits and reverted to using a simple brute force and subsequently dropping a shell script, for self-propagation.

CAMPAIGN 3: Hakai
Earlier samples belonging to this campaign use all the exploits detailed in Table 1, except for the UPnP SOAP TelnetD Command Execution exploit.  The payload source for this campaign was hxxp://hakaiboatnet[.]pw/m and the C2 server was 178[.]128.185.250. Samples make use of an encryption scheme similar to Mirai; unlike previous campaigns, they are built on the Gafgyt source code, which is also known as Bashlite, Lizkebab, Torlus or LizardStresser.
Samples listen for the following commands:



Command
Translation


SC ON
Scanner On


SC OFF
Scanner Off


H
HTTP Flood


U
UDP Flood


S
STD Flood


T
TCP Flood


KT
Kill scanner threads



 
Newer samples from the same server were found to have also incorporated an OS Command Injection exploit against D-Link DSL-2750B devices. These samples use the same attack methods, encryption key and C2 as the samples above, however they source their payload from hxxp://178[.]128.185.250/e.

Gafgyt with a new Layer-7 attack
Layer-7 DDoS attacks targeting specific DDoS protection service vendors are not new and were already observed in the form of the DvrHelper variant of Mirai.
They have however not been observed used by Gafgyt samples until now. While pivoting on the C2 used by samples of Campaign 1, I came across some Gafgyt samples listening for an additional command called HTTPCF.
When this command is received, the bot calls a function called SendHTTPCloudflare that does as its name suggests, targeting a URL path used mostly by sites protected by Cloudflare. The earliest samples observed using this attack were from the end of May 2018.

Figure 8: URL format targeted by HTTPCF
Samples use the same IP i.e. 213[.]183.53.120 at port 8013 for C2 communication.
They also make use of some unusual User-Agents (UA) as seen in Figure 9. All UAs found in these samples are listed in the appendix

Figure 9: Some unusual User Agents found in related Gafgyt samples
Conclusion
The initial rise of botnets targeting embedded systems had brought to light the security risks from millions of Internet-connected devices configured with default credentials.
The evolution of these botnets to the use of multiple exploits, be it IoT Reaper or the campaigns discussed here, shows how attackers can build enormous botnets consisting of different types of devices, all responding to the same C2 server. This is exacerbated by the speed of exploitation in the wild of newly released vulnerabilities and also highlights the need for security vendor reactivity in response to these disclosures, applicable to the subset of these devices that do fall under the protection of security devices. However, the onus is on device manufacturers to ensure their devices are easy to update, and that they deploy the updates in a timely manner.
