  Vulnerability Spotlight: TALOS-2018-0535 - Ocularis Recorder VMS_VA Denial of Service Vulnerability



Vulnerabilities discovered by Carlos Pacho from Talos



Overview
Talos is disclosing a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Ocularis Recorder. Ocularis is a video management software (VMS) platform used in a variety of settings, from convenience stores, to city-wide deployments. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malicious network packet that causes a process to terminate, resulting in a denial of service.


Details
An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Ocularis Recorder functionality of Ocularis 5.5.0.242. A specially crafted TCP packet can cause a process to terminate, resulting in denial of service.

The VMS_VA server process is listening for incoming TCP connections on a port in the range of 60801-65535. When a client connects to it and sends any unexpected data, the binary will respond with "Hello World!" The binary has a check to see if the receiving data starts with "dispose.” If it does, the server process kills itself. There is no authentication required for this command to go through. Any attacker with network access to the server application can use this to execute a denial-of-service attack. 

Ocularis has released patches for versions 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 (https://onssi.com/software-downloads/)
