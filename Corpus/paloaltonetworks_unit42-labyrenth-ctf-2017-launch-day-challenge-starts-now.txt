LabyREnth CTF 2017 Launch Day: The Challenge Starts Now!


The LabyREnth Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge is LIVE!
The goblins are at the gate and in this final hour it’s time for your many hours studying the blade, mastering the blockchain, and cultivating inner strength to be put to use. You’ll have until 4:00 p.m. pacific time on July 23, 2017 to test your mettle against the seemingly endless hordes of more than 25 security challenges.  Will you answer the call?
Whether you are an experienced researcher looking to win renown or a student just getting started, these challenges are built to surprise and show you something new. And if you’re among the first to complete the tracks, you could win a chunk of the $32,000 in cash prizes we’re offering this year. The CTF is open worldwide, including Palo Alto Networks partners.  Please refer to the official rules at LabyREnth by typing “rules” in the terminal.
These challenges bring together amazing learning opportunities for all levels across the security industry, all with serious prizes. Our goal is to drive threat intelligence education by sharing challenges based on the daily life of our engineers, helping improve skills and developing the next generation of analysts. By creating an avenue to build security skills, we’re making an effort to improve and strengthen the security community and our collective ability to defend against attackers.
