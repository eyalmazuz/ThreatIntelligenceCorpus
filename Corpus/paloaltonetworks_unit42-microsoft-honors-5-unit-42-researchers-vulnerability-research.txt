Microsoft Honors 5 Unit 42 Researchers for Vulnerability Research

Every year at Black Hat, Microsoft publishes the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) Bounty Program Top 100, a list of the top contributors to the company’s vulnerabilities disclosure program. This year, five Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence researchers were recognized at Black Hat USA 2017 for their contributions to preventing security incidents and advancing Microsoft product security. Congratulations to Bo Qu, Tao Yan, Hui Gao, Tongbo Luo, and Jin Chen!
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research in Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Android and other ecosystems. By proactively identifying vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft for patching, we are removing weapons used by attackers that compromise enterprise, government and service provider networks.
