TALOS-2017-0506
TALOS-2017-0506 / CVE-2017-14458 in an exploitable use-after-free vulnerability that exists specifically in the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees up a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. Taking advantage of this, a specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, which results in arbitrary code execution. There are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack, including tricking a user into opening a malicious PDF. Or, if the browser plugin is enabled, simply viewing the document on the internet could result in exploitation. Full details of the vulnerability can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0525
TALOS-2018-0525 / CVE-2018-3842 results from an exploitable use of an uninitialized pointer in the Javascript engine in the Foxit PDF Reader that can result in remote code execution. A specially craft PDF file could trigger this vulnerability. There are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack including tricking a user to opening a malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, simply viewing the document on the Internet could result in exploitation. Full details of the vulnerability can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0526
TALOS-2018-0526 / CVE-2018-3843 results from a type confusion vulnerability in the way Foxit PDF reader parses files with associated extensions.

Full details of the vulnerability can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0532
TALOS-2018-0532 / CVE-2018-3850 is a use-after-free vulnerability that exists in the Javascript engine of the Foxit PDF Reader. This specific vulnerability lies in the 'this.xfa.clone()' method, which results in a use-after-free condition. A specially crafted PDF file could trigger this vulnerability resulting in sensitive memory disclosure or, potentially, arbitrary code execution.  There are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack including tricking a user to opening a malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, simply viewing the document on the Internet could result in exploitation. Full details of the vulnerability can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0536
