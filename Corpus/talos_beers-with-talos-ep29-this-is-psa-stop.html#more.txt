EP29 Show Notes: 
Recorded May 11, 2018 - First and foremost, we recorded this episode one day before our "birthday." We want to thank everyone, especially the listeners, who have let us do this for the past year, racking up over half a million downloads! In this episode, we welcome special guest Nick Biasini from Talos Outreach. We set out to talk about several topics, but spend most of our time with Nick around the idea of building a stronger culture of cybersecurity and what it will take to get the baseline users on board.  We are missing Matt this week, and hope he had an amazing time following the DMB tour up to Burlington, or whatever he was doing.

The Timeline:

Email us your answer  before May 25 and we’ll put your name in a drawing for a BWT loot box.
