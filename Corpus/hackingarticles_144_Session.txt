Session Hijacking using Ettercap, Hamster and Ferret (A Beginner Guide)

From Wikipedia
Session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to web developers, as the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim’s computer.
