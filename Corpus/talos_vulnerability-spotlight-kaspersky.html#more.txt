Overview


Talos is disclosing the presence of TALOS-2016-0175 / CVE-2016-4329, a local denial of service vulnerability within Kaspersky anti-virus. A system user is able to cause a denial of service attack against Kaspersky’s avpui.exe process by executing malicious code on a system. As a result, avpui.exe process protected by Kaspersky Self-Protection dies.



The vulnerability can only be exploited by a user who is already present on the system. Nevertheless, such a vulnerability potentially may be exploited by a malicious user who wished to cause anti-virus scanning to stop informing users about potential malicious activities. This may comprise a step in a longer sequence of malicious activity. Administrators should ensure that the latest version of Kaspersky is installed to remove the vulnerability.
