Ponmocup
 A giant hiding in the shadows

Version 1.1
November 30, 2015

Executive Summary

Ponmocup, first discovered in 2006 as Vundo or Virtumonde, is one  
of the most successful botnets of the past decade, in terms of spread 
and persistence. Furthermore, the reasons why this botnet is considered 
highly interesting are that it is sophisticated, underestimated and is 
currently largest in size and aimed at financial gain. 

This underestimated botnet is still in active use and under continuous development. 
Having established that Ponmocup’s primary goal is likely financial gain, it is interesting 
to look at its size. fox-it has determined that it has infected a cumulative total of 
more than 15 million unique victims since 2009. At its peak, in July 2011, the botnet 
consisted of 2.4 million infected systems, which as far as botnets go, is huge. Since 
then, the botnet has shrunk in size and is currently stable at around 500,000 active 
infections, as shown in Figure 1. 

Compared to other botnets, Ponmocup is one of the largest currently active and, with  
9 consecutive years, also one of the longest running. Ponmocup is rarely noticed though, 
as the operators take care to keep it operating under the radar.

Ponmocup’s operators are technically sophisticated, their techniques suggest a deeper 
than regular knowledge of the Windows operating system. On top of that, the operators 
have close to 10 years of experience with malware development. Their framework was 
developed over time, quality tested and then improved  in order to increase robustness 
and reduce the likelihood of discovery.

The operators are most likely Russian speaking and possibly of Russian origin. This is based 
on the fact that instructions to business partners and affiliates are written in Russian, 
and that historically, Ponmocup would not infect systems in some post-Soviet States.

Development of Ponmocup

‹(cid:4)(cid:4),(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)
Ponmocup is believed to be aimed at financial gain. Although it is difficult to quantify 
the exact amount of money earned with the Ponmocup botnet, it is likely that it has 
already been a multi-million dollar business for years now. There are multiple reasons to 
assume this is the case. Firstly, their infrastructure is complex, distributed and extensive,  
with servers for dedicated tasks. Secondly, they operate, maintain and monitor their 
comprehensive infrastructure with a group of operators and are quickly able to mitigate 
potential risks that are discovered. Thirdly, the malware itself is sophisticated and aimed 
at avoiding detection and analysis. fox-it believes, based on the earlier mentioned 
reasons, that they are protecting a very well run organization and infrastructure, for 
their main goal: financial gain.

1  Introduction

Ponmocup, first 
discovered in 2006 as 
Vundo or Virtumonde, 
is one of the most 
successful botnets  
of the past decade,  
in terms of spread and 
persistence.

fox-it believes this is an underestimated botnet currently still in active use and under 
continuous development. Though Ponmocup has received only minimal attention 
from the security community and is often described as low risk, it is in fact a technically 
sophisticated malware framework with extensive functionality. The result of our 
research provides a complete time-line and unique insight into the modus operandi of 
the operation around Ponmocup and describes all the important details of the malware. 
Furthermore, this report includes currently not publicly known indicators of compromise, 
both on host and network level, where previous research only scratched the surface.

This chapter discusses non-technical aspects of the Ponmocup botnet: 
attribution, goals, impact and size.

releases of various components, in order to increase 
robustness and reduce the likelihood of discovery. This 
includes the fact that everything in the framework (APis, 
strings, etc) is obfuscated. Furthermore, the infrastructure 
is well thought out and load balances victims between 
domains and proxies as an anti-sinkhole measure. Finally, 
the framework uses a number of anti-analysis methods, 
such as the fake payload and blacklisting of iP addresses 
and system fingerprints once an analyst or researcher 
is found. Some of these techniques will be discussed in 
more detail further on in this paper.

2.2 Goals and impact
As with any modern malware, the Ponmocup framework is 
capable of supporting any objective, be it criminal or espi-
onage-oriented in nature. These theoretical capabilities, 
however, aren’t very useful in order to determine the oper-
ator’s actual goals. Ponmocup’s real goals have remained 
somewhat elusive over the years, primarily because fox-it 
has only rarely seen any sustained activities taking place.
Based on what is known now, Ponmocup’s operators 
are believed to be primarily interested in financial gain. 
However, they are currently either applying extreme 
restraint or carrying out their activities outside of  
fox-it’s sphere of knowledge. Either way, they cherish 
their botnet and handle it with care. This can be supported 
by the following observations.

As shown in paragraph 2.3, Ponmocup is a large botnet, 
supporting a large amount of victims. This is a direct 
result of its design:
1 

It is difficult for traditional anti-virus solutions to 
reliably detect because it uses unique encryption per 
infected system and locates its core components in 
a unique location per infected system.
It uses one-time domains for installation, which means 
that these domains cannot be used as indicators of 
compromise over time or across organization.

2 

2.1  Attribution
This section describes a number of aspects related to 
the operators of the Ponmocup botnet.

Based on the size of the command and control infrastruc-
ture, it is thought that the infrastructure is maintained, 
monitored and protected by a well-organized group of 
operators. This is amongst others based on the domains 
in use, number of proxies in use, estimated number of 
back-end systems, used delivery methods and limited 
affiliate schemes. 
It was also observed that in certain cases, the operators 
reacted quickly to events which could impact the botnet’s 
infrastructure, suggesting that the operators closely 
monitor their back-end infrastructure.
In addition, some operators were observed as active 
members in underground advertisement fraud forum or 
signed up for underground advertisement fraud schemes.

It is believed that the operators are most likely Russian 
speaking and possibly of Russian origin. This is based 
on the fact that instructions to business partners and 
affiliates are written in Russian, and that in the early days, 
Ponmocup would not infect systems in the post-Soviet 
States of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. However, this 
specific block was later removed, for unknown reasons.

As for technical capabilities, it can be said that the oper-
ators are fairly sophisticated. The successful combination 
of various components to execute a stealthy malware 
framework, in addition to the usage of undocumented 
Windows APis to reset system restore points, suggests 
deeper than regular knowledge of the Windows operating  
system. On top of that, it is certain that the operators have 
close to 10 years of experience with malware development,  
as the first variant of Ponmocop (Vundo) was discovered 
in 2006. This translates into features of the framework 
that were developed over time, quality tested with debug

It supports theft of ftP and Facebook credentials 
out of the box, which fox-it believes may be used to 
support further spreading the botnet if needed.

Finally, Ponmocup is believed to be aimed at financial 
gain for the following reasons:

cated AV evasion techniques, trying to stay under the 
radar as much as possible, in order to avoid detection.

that they are protecting a very well run organization

2.3  Size
Having established that Ponmocup’s primary goal is 
likely financial gain, it is interesting to look at its size. 
fox-it has determined that Ponmocup has infected a 
cumulative total of more than 15 million unique victims 
since 2009. At its peak, in July 2011, the botnet consisted 
of 2.4 million infected systems, which as far as botnets go, 
is huge. The botnet has since then shrunk in size as a result 
of a coordinated sinkhole action and natural rotation of 
bots. Currently, there are still more than 500,000 victims 
checking in to command and control servers each month. 
For distribution purposes, more than 5000 websites have 
been compromised since 2009, using ftP credentials 
stolen by Ponmocup components, in order to further 
spread the malware.

Compared to other botnets, Ponmocup is one of the

one of the longest running. Ponmocup is rarely noticed 
though, as the operators take care to keep it operating 
under the radar. An update that included a failed printer 
exploit, in 2012, provided a rare moment in the lime lights: 
it caused printers worldwide to start printing garbage 
data until they ran out of paper or ink1.

3   Overview of the technical 

framework

Ponmocup is a malware framework, written in C++, designed to infect 
and remain persistent on a large number of victim machines. This 
chapter describes the components that comprise the framework.

3.1  Framework components
The  Ponmocup  framework  employs  a  number  of  
components to deliver, install, execute and control 
the malware, as listed in Table 1. Each component uses  
different anti-analysis methods to prevent the framework 
from being discovered.

Reverse engineering the functionalities can be a labor- 
intensive process, as the malware executes over  
various stages, where each string is decrypted in-line 
using various algorithms. Components that are integral 
to the functioning of the framework are often encrypted 
or stored using information specific to a victim’s system.

3.2 Typical Ponmocup infrastructure
The infrastructure used to control the botnet is designed 
to be resilient to disruption attempts, using a separate 
infrastructure per component. This requires an extensive 
server set-up which is constantly monitored for perfor-
mance issues and disruption attempts by external parties.
 
Ponmocup communicates to back-end servers over several 
proxy layers and each victim can use a specific group of 
proxies to communicate. Using proxy groups means that 
the botnet is spread over several domains, a technique 
that makes taking down the entire botnet difficult.

Table 1: Overview of Ponmocup components and their purpose

The operators have gone out of their way to try and defeat 
detection by anti-virus software, automated analysis, as 
well as manual analysis. Their attempts have proven very 
successful: over the last five years only a few analyses 
of Ponmocup have been published, of which none have 
managed to uncover the full truth of the framework. 

Plug-ins carrying out specific tasks or exfiltrating specific 
data make use of separate proxies as well as separate 
back-end servers.

A simplified overview of the infrastructure between the 
operators and a victim is shown in Figure 3.

4  Delivery methods

This chapter describes historic and current delivery methods used to 
distribute the Ponmocup malware

From 2009 to 2011 the two main methods used to  
distribute Ponmocup were fake codec packs and fake 
Flash Player updates. However, after a sinkhole attempt 
in 2011 2 the authors developed their own distribution 
method, publicly known as Zuponcic 3, named after  
the first website that was compromised for distri bution 
purposes using this method. Although Zuponcic is  

via a search engine, social media network or webmail 
application. This reduces the number of potential victims, 
but often filters out potential victims that would more 
easily notice a website behaving out of the ordinary, 
such as the owner of the website or frequent visitors.  
A snippet from the .htaccess file checking for valid 
referrers:

|myspace\.|bebo\.).*$ [NC,OR]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^(http\:\/\/)?([^\/\?]*\.)?(tweet|twit|linkedin|instagram|facebook\. 
 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^(http\:\/\/)?([^\/\?]*\.)?(hi5\.|blogspot\.|friendfeed\.|friendster\. 
 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER}^(http\:\/\/)?([^\/\?]*\.)?(yahoo\.|bing\.|msn\.|ask\.|excite\.|altavista\. 
 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER}^(http\:\/\/)?([^\/\?]*\.)?(aol\.|hotbot\.|goto\.|infoseek\.|mamma\. 
 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER}^(http\:\/\/)?([^\/\?]*\.)?(lycos\.|metacrawler\.|mail\.|PINterest 
 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER}!^.*(imgres).*$   [NC]

|alltheweb\.).*$ [NC,OR]

|google\.).*$ [NC,OR]

|netscape\.).*$ [NC,OR]

|instagram).*$   [NC]

commonly described as an exploit kit, that actually isn’t 
an accurate description because it doesn’t use exploits. 
Instead, it uses three distinct infection vectors, which 
in most cases depend on interaction with the victim.

Websites affected by Zuponcic are typically compromised 
using ftP credentials, stolen from machines infected by 
Ponmocup. This allows the operators behind Ponmocup 
to upload a carefully crafted .htaccess file to every acces-
sible folder. It redirects visitors from the compromised 
website to the Zuponcic delivery mechanism. The 
code in the .htaccess file responsible for this redirect 
is placed between 500 blank lines to make it seem as 
if the file is empty. This code itself makes sure that not 
just anyone gets redirected to the malicious website; 
the visitor must have visited the compromised website 

Once a visitor is attacked by Zuponcic, their iP-address is 
blacklisted and will no longer be targeted until the iP-address 
is cleared from the blacklist, regardless of whether the attack 
was successful or not. Additionally a cookie is placed on the 
machine to make sure that not only the iP-address, but also the 
actual machine itself is blacklisted. Potential victims redirected 
by the .htaccess file are first taken to an intermediate website 
(typically hijacked GoDaddy domains) using one out of 60 
listed URI patterns. The conditions that a potential victim 
has to meet in order to be attacked are visualized in Figure 5.

Because Zuponcic requires a valid referrer chain and blacklists 
an iP-address after a single hit and most URL analysis tools fail 
to perform dynamic analysis on these compromised websites, 
most of these websites are falsely classified as ‘safe’ and 
remain compromised for relatively longer periods.

10 | fox-it | Ponmocup | A giant hiding in the shadows | November 2015

Once a visitor is actually redirected to the Zuponcic 
landing page he or she is targeted based on the used 
browser and presence of the Java browser plug-in. The 
decision chart in Figure 6 depicts the various methods 
used to infect visitors with the Ponmocup payload. The 
next paragraphs describe each method in more detail.

4.1  Delivery through ZIP file
Using a browser other than Internet Explorer 8/10 or  
not having Java installed, a victim will receive a ZiP file 
containing the payload. The name of the ZiP and embedded 
payload is derived from the previously used search terms, 
as shown inFigure 4.

Compared to the attack vectors abusing Java, described 
in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3, this attack method puts in very 
little effort to hide the payload. Perhaps the operators felt 
safe enough to introduce this method to their arsenal of 
infection vectors at the cost of slightly more attention.

4.2 Delivery through a signed Java applet
This infection vector relies on social engineering or out-
dated Java software in order to execute a Java applet.
These applets are typically run in a sandbox, in order to 
prevent them from touching the file system, so to drop 
the Ponmocup installer on a victim’s machine this Java 
applet has to escape the sandbox. Ponmocup success-
fully does so because the Java applet is signed with a 
valid certificate, stolen from a legitimate organization. 
Older versions of Java (pre-dating Java 7 Update 21 to 
be specific) which blindly trust certificates issued by 
authorities, will run this applet outside of the sandbox 
without even asking for the user’s permission.

Recent versions of Java always prompt for user approval 
before running applets, though in this case the applet 
might still appear legitimate to potential victims, as the 
applet is still signed with a valid certificate and claims to 
be executing an application with the name ‘FlashPlayer’. 
The certificates listed in Table 2 have all been used by 
Zuponcic to infect victims with Ponmocup.

Figure 4: Using victim’s own keywords for payload filename

Because the certificates used by Zuponcic are stolen from 
victims that have been infected by Ponmocup, it typically 
does not take long for a revoked certificate to be replaced 
by a new one. In most cases revoked certificates were 
replaced with a newly stolen certificate within 1–3 weeks.

The file doing all the work, FlashPlayer.class, is heavily 
obfuscated using control flow obfuscation. Additionally, 
all strings are encoded using an encoding key which  
consists of dynamic values from the process stack. This 
works if the class and calling method names are static, 
which has always been the case for Zuponcic; the class 
name is ‘FlashPlayer’ and calling method is ‘init’, which 
results in ‘FlashPlayerinit’ as the decoding key.

final StackTraceElement 
stackTraceElement = new Exception().
getStackTrace()[1];
final String string = new 
StringBuffer(stackTraceElement.
getMethodName()).insert(0, 
stackTraceElement.getClassName()).
toString();

FlashPlayer.class will create an empty .tmp file with a 
random short name (2–5 characters) in the tEMP directory.

was visited, whether the execution is successful or 
not, leaving to believe nothing strange has happened,  
a process outlined in Figure 7.
If execution of the payload fails, FlashPlayer.class ensures 
that the created .tmp file is deleted from disk. This clean-up 
routine prevents any evidence from being left around.

4.3 Delivery through a JAR loader
A target using IE10 will receive a JAR file which has to be 
manually downloaded and executed. It may seem unlikely 
for anyone to run this manually, but through clever social 

engineering, Zuponcic tricks many victims into running 
its malicious payload. This is done by using the search 
terms used in the redirecting search engine in the payload 
name, as shown in the example in Figure 4.
This JAR file contains an RC4 encrypted payload. The key is 
based on the target’s iP address. This means the key and 
the embedded encrypted binary are unique per target. 
Once the JAR is executed, the code below recovers the 
RC4 key used for decryption:

final URLConnection openConnection;
(openConnection = new URL("http://checkip.dyndns.com").openConnection()).
setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)");
final BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new 
InputStreamReader(openConnection.getInputStream()));
final String readLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
String group = "";
bufferedReader.close();
final Matcher matcher;
if ((matcher = Pattern.compile("([0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})").
matcher(readLine)).find()) 
{
    group = matcher.group();
}
final byte[] digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5").digest(group.getBytes());

5   Installation, persistence  

and functionality

This chapter describes the core components of Ponmocup, its method 
of installation, achieving persistence and its modular system of plug-ins 
aimed at providing a wide variety of functions on compromised systems.

If stored in the system directory the file will have the R 
(Read-only), S (System) and H (Hidden) attributes set. The 
installer adds a scheduled task to start the initiator during 
system boot, with the privileges of NT AUTHORITY\
SYSTEM:

<Principals>
<Principal id="Author">
<UserId>System</UserId>
<RunLevel>HighestAvailable</RunLevel>
<LogonType>InteractiveTokenOrPassword 
 
</Principal>
</Principals>
<Actions Context="Author">
<Exec>
<Command>C:\Windows\system32\ 
 
<Arguments>"C:\Windows\system32\ 
 
</Exec>
</Actions>

msg711A.DLL",ZBADQX</Arguments>

</LogonType>

runDLL32.exe</Command>

Without administrative privileges the initiator is stored 
in the Application Data directory with a random name 
(6–10 characters) and initiated during system boot via  
a run-key in the registry.

During installation some additional tasks are carried out 
by the installer to ensure persistence. One of these tasks, 
not often seen, is to delete all system restore points and 
to disable the system restore option itself. To achieve this 
Ponmocup makes use of two APis from the srclient.DLL 
library; srclient.ResetSR and srclient.DisableSR. These 
APis are not documented by Microsoft, which is one of 

5.1  The Ponmocup installer
The installer is responsible for persistently installing 
various Ponmocup components on a system. This para-
graph focuses on components installed directly on disk. 
All other core components are stored and encrypted in 
the registry. Without these, the initiator described in this 
chapter cannot function.

Depending on the privileges available to the installer, 
the initiator can either be installed in the system direc-
tory or in the Application Data directory. When run with 
administrative privileges, the initiator will be named after 
an existing file in the system directory, with 1–2 random 
characters appended. For example, a randomly selected 
legitimate file could be:

C:\Windows\System32\msg711.acm

And the Ponmocup initiator would be named:

C:\Windows\System32\msg711A.DLL

This effectively means 
that the core function- 
alities of Ponmocup  
are uniquely encrypted  
and stored in a unique  
location for every victim.

the indicators that the operators have a thorough under-
standing of windows internals, which displays a certain 
level of sophistication which is seen throughout the entire 
framework. One of these particular APis (ResetSR) was 
also used by the Conficker worm 4.

5.2 Core functionality
The core of Ponmocup are the components installed on 
a victim’s machine by default. These mainly include the 
components responsible for starting the main module, 
but also include persistent plug-ins providing specific 
tasks for persistence purposes.
As shown in Figure 8, loading Ponmocup is a multi-step 
process which is best broken down into three categories: 
files on disk, activity in memory and the usage of stored 
information in the Windows registry.

Starting the Ponmocup core is a three part process 
consisting of the DLL on disk (initiator), a custom UPx 
compressed DLL in memory (loader) and the payloads 
in registry (main module and plug-ins):
1  The initiator is started by the scheduled task or run key;
2  Once loaded into memory the initiator transfers 

control to a (modified) UPx compressed DLL;

3  This DLL acts as a loader for the main module and 

plug-ins.

The loader has the most important responsibilities in this 
process, as it has to find the main module and plug-ins, 
which are all encrypted and only stored in registry; both 
the encryption key and location are based on unique 
aspects of a victim’s machine. This effectively means 
that the core functionalities of Ponmocup are uniquely 
encrypted and stored in a unique location for every victim.

The following unique information about the victim’s 
machine is used to base the encryption on:
•  Date and time of the system directory creation
•  Volume serial number of the root directory of the 
volume Ponmocup is installing on, retrieved through 
the GetVolumeInformation API

•  Date and time of the System Volume Information 

directory creation

As can be seen in the code snippet below, these unique 
values are each xoR’d with their combined value, forming 
a 16 bytes key which is used to encrypt the main module. 
For encryption a slightly modified version of the RC4 
algorithm is used.

These values are used to uniquely generate the location 
of the main module and plug-ins in the Windows Registry. 
An example of what the registry keys might look like:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\wkcxjxlv\
Wjtnpgzc

In this case the ‘Wjtnpgzc’ key stores the Ponmocup main 
module, and persistent plug-ins. Once decrypted using 
the unique key, the value of this registry key is typically 
outlined as follows:
•  Total size of decrypted content (first 4 bytes);
•  Main module;
•  Persistent plug-in(s).

Using this machine specific information the loader 
can find the location of the encrypted main module  
and plug-ins in the Windows Registry, decrypt their  
contents and execute the payloads. Before decrypting, 
these machine-specific values are verified against the 
checksums, which were stored in the registry during 
installation, to check if none of these values have changed. 
If these checks succeed, the decryption routine is started.

After decryption the loader verifies the integrity of the 
decrypted content by comparing the CRC32 checksum 
of the result with the checksum of the content before it 
was stored in registry during installation. Once this final 
check succeeds, plug-ins stored in registry are executed 
and control is given to the main module, which can then 
initiate command and control traffic. If at any stage during 
this process, a verification or integrity check fails, the 
Ponmocup execution process halts.
The main module and plug-ins can interact with each 
other using shared memory. This functionality is mainly 
used by plug-ins that only run if the main module is indeed 
actively running.

Both the main module and plug-ins use the registry to 
store configs, checksums or other relevant information 
storage such as counters or iDs. Information storage that 
may be helpful during a forensic investigation could, for 
example, be:
•  Main PiN5 iD

-  A PiN indicates a group of plug-ins which will be 
run on a victim’s machine at some point in time.

/* setup keys */
key_1[0] = tsys32dir.dwLowDateTime ^ tsys32dir. dwHighDateTime;
key_1[1] = dwVolumeSerial;
key_1[2] = tsysvolinfodir.dwLowDateTime ^ tsysvolinfodir.dwHighDateTime;
key_1[3] = key_1[2] + key_1[0] + key_1[1] - 0x6F6F6F70;

/* xor */
key_1[0] ^= key_1[3];
key_1[1] ^= key_1[3];
key_1[2] ^= key_1[3];

18 | fox-it | Ponmocup | A giant hiding in the shadows | November 2015

-  Some of these plug-ins that belong to the PiN 
can be persistent, but some plug-ins might only 
be executed once. Knowing the PiN iD could  
help identify what type of tasks may have been 
executed on a victim’s machine.
If, for example, this value stores 0x4A39, the  
PiN iD is 19001. Please see the next paragraph  
for more detailed information.

- 

•  Run counter

-  The main module increases a counter in registry 

- 

for every minute it’s been active.
If, for example, this value stores 0x0F, the main 
module has been active for 15 minutes.

Basic information storage can be found in separate  
registry keys in the following location:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\
Multimedia

These values can also be stored in other locations for 
redundancy purposes.

5.3  Specific functionality through plug-ins
The main module of Ponmocup is primarily designed  
to achieve persistence on a victim’s machine. Plug-ins,  
in contrast, are used to provide functionalities for specific 
tasks. These tasks vary from the exfiltration of credentials 
and browser history, to identification of VoiP agents  
on the network of victims. In total fox-it has identified 
25 plug-ins with unique identifiers, among them they 

share more than 4000 different versions, indicating this 
framework is under continuous development. 
The following paragraphs describe some of the more 
prominent plug-ins used in the Ponmocup framework.

Plug-ins can either be present in memory only, or remain 
persistent by being stored and encrypted in the same  
registry key as the main module. Whether or not a plug-in 
remains persistent is dependent on the type of functional-
ities the plug-in provides. Once retrieved, a plug-in can make 
itself persistent by using the machine specific information, 
mentioned in chapter 5.2, to encrypt and append itself to 
the registry key which stores the main module and the other 
plug-ins. The quality of the plug-ins are thoroughly tested 
using specifically developed debug versions.

Identifying plug-ins is possible by analyzing their PE 
headers: at offset 0x20 a standard PE header contains a 
reserved word (WoRD e_res[4]), of which e_res[3] is used 
by Ponmocup to store the iD of the corresponding plug-in. 
The version of the plug-in iD can be found 3 bytes further 
at WoRD e_oemid.

In the example below, the PE header stores the value 
0x044C (little-endian) in WoRD e_res[3] and 0x0BBB  
(little-endian) in WoRD e_oemid, resulting in plug-in iD ‘1100’ 
and version ‘3003’ (typically written as plug-in 1100.3003).

Table 2 provides an overview of the most important  
plug-ins, which are basically all DLLs given a unique iden-
tifier, version number and name by the operators.

redirected to an alternative page (taken from an encrypted config in the registry).  
This plug-in is specifically used for the PiN 190xx range.
Precursor of the 18xx plug-in range, allowing the operators to connect to a victim directly, 
this connection is typically set-up to a specific port opened in the Windows firewall.
Precursor of the 25xx plug-in range, allowing the operators to connect to a victim directly, 
this connection is typically set-up to a specific port opened in the Windows firewall.
Used to directly connect to infected machines. To make sure machines behind a device 
providing network address translation (NAt) can still be reached individually, UPnP  
is used, and ports 1900 (UDP) and 2869 (tCP) are opened in the Windows firewall.
Similar to the other plug-ins in the 2500 range, this plug-in can be used to directly  
connect to infected machines.

using a list of commonly used passwords. fox-it has not yet observed abuse of these 
credentials on a large scale. It is therefore suspected that they may be used in the event 
of a significant loss in the number of victims, necessitating the introduction of a new 
spreading mechanism by the Ponmocup operators.
Gathers extensive information about an infected machine, also scans for a long and

To efficiently distribute certain functionalities to a 
victim, plug-ins can be grouped into a so called ‘PiN’ 
as earlier mentioned. For example, the PiN that has 
been most actively used since June 2012 is identified 
as PiN 19001 and contains 10 unique plug-ins. The table

5.3.1  Plug-ins #14xx range – decide: finding interesting 

targets

Through this type of plug-in, operators can retrieve the 
browser history for all major browsers. Not only will such 
a plug-in parse the history from, for example, the SQLite 
database of Google Chrome, but it will also retrieve the 
hostnames of the cookies stored on the target’s machine.

This browser history is collected for the plug-in to check 
its content against specific keywords of interest to the 
Ponmocup operators. To prevent the interests of the 
operators from becoming known, these keywords are 
only checked in the form of CRC32 checksums. These 
keywords can be divided into 4 categories: online banking,

plug-ins is possible  
by analyzing their

investment websites, accounting websites and websites 
used to store personal information, which are used for 
intelligence purposes (for example law enforcement 
software or online insurance websites). An example  
of such keywords recovered by fox-it, is shown in the 
snippet below.

In total fox-it has identified 214 unique keywords, 
APPENDix I contains the full list of recovered keywords.
The goal of this plug-in is clear: identifying targets of 
interest based on their browsing behavior.

Through analysis of three specific versions of the decide

5.3.2  Plug-in #2600 – SiP scanner: collecting 

information on SiP gateways

This plug-in attempts to identify SiP gateways on the local 
subnet of a victim. SiP, the Sessions Initiation Protocol,  
is a communications protocol used to setup and connect  
communications sessions, typically for voice and video 

calls. In the example below the plug-in identifies that 
the gateway iP 10.0.0.1 is running an Asterisk server; 
a software implementation of a telephone private 
branch exchange (PBx) which can be used to set-up VoiP 
connections.

All the discovered information is then encrypted and exfiltrated to a dedicated plug-in proxy, and stored in the back-end, 
where the operators can query the data for information of interest.

Because the processing of this data happens on back-end servers, fox-it does not know the exact purpose of harvesting this 
type of information. Having access to SiP gateways could be useful for VoiP fraud, but would also allow for the interception 
of voice/video communication. 

In total Fox-IT has identified 25 plug-ins
with unique identifiers, among them they 
share more than 4000 different versions, 
indicating this framework is under continuous 
development.

5.3.3  Plug-in #2610 – router scan: collecting router 

information

This plug-in identifies what gateway iP the victim’s 
machine uses (for example 10.0.0.1) and then attempts  
to identify if, on that gateway, any services respond on 
the following ports:
•  22 (SSH)
•  23 (Telnet)
•  80 (HttP)
•  443 (HttPS)
•  8080 (Alternative HttP port, often used by proxies)
Using an example of a typical router with an example 
page on the gateway iP, this plug-in would exfiltrate the 
following information:

Additionally the plug-in will attempt to access the web-
server on port 80 via the /admin URL, and exfiltrates 
the server’s response. In the example below the /admin

Because  the  processing  of  this  data  happens  on  
back-end servers, fox-it does not know the exact purpose 
of harvesting this type of information. Storing informa-
tion on router devices could help in further propagating 
Ponmocup through the local network, but could also aid 
in identifying interesting targets.

5.3.4  Plug-in for MS10-061 vulnerability: lateral 

movement

12 June 2012, the day of the renewed Ponmocup release: 
a plug-in containing an exploit for the vulnerability in the 
Microsoft print spooler service 10, first used as a zero-day 
by Stuxnet two years earlier, is added to the group of  
plug-ins that are pushed to every newly infected machine, 
a move the operators would soon come to regret.

By impersonating the print spooler service Ponmocup 
could move its payload into the system directory and

execute it with system privileges on unpatched Windows 
machines. This effectively made Ponmocup a worm and 
the amount of infected machines increased significantly.

However when a Windows system was patched for the 
vulnerability, the payload would not be written to the 
system directory, but instead, to the default print spooler 
folder; the directory used by Windows to queue printer 
jobs. The print spooler service then saw the Ponmocup 
binary as a print job, and continued to send it to the 
printer, which then carried on to print the binary. Because 
the exploit is attempted multiple times, the printers 
usually just kept on printing, until they ran out of either 
paper or ink.

Once companies all over the world started complaining  
about their printers printing, what was presumably,  
‘garbage data’, the story was soon picked up by the media, 
something the Ponmocup operators picked up on as well, 
as the plug-in was removed the very next day. To avoid 
even more attention the plug-in was removed from the 
default plug-in list and was never re-used as a separate 
plug-in again.

6  Command and control traffic

All Ponmocup components that can communicate with command and 
control servers contain hardcoded domains. These domains are not 
command and control servers and are not used to send data to, but are 
merely used to calculate the IP addresses of the actual command and 
control servers. 

To achieve this, Ponmocup resolves the hardcoded 
domain and converts the returned IP into a hex value. It 
then takes the CRC32 checksum of the domain and xoRs 
these two values with each other, recovering the real 
command and control iP address. 
This is visualized in Figure 11. In the example above the 
main module contains the hardcoded domain ‘claims-
reference.net’. As this domain has no direct relation to any 
actual Ponmocup infrastructure, this is a clever method 
of hiding the real command and control servers from 
any prying eyes.

commonly used by legitimate websites.

•  A command and control server typically returns a  
“404 Not Found” HttP response to make it seem as if 
the page does not exist and isn’t accepting any data.
•  Data is RC4 encrypted but the key is generated  

differently per component.

•  The encrypted data is stored in the ‘Cookie’ header.
-  Data is serialized into multiple fields, each Cookie 
name is randomly chosen out of a list of 177 key-
words which are commonly used by legitimate 
websites.

Additionally, to avoid detection by intrusion detection and 
prevention systems, the operators behind Ponmocup have 
put in a lot of effort to hide its command and control traffic:
•  Command and control traffic only occurs once to 
Figure 10: Conversion of a hardcoded domain to an 
twice every two days and occurs at random times.
actual command and control address
•  URLs are randomly structured from a combination of 
two lists, both containing 50+ unique paths which are 

•  Plug-ins use separate proxies and back-ends to which 

they log exfiltrated data.

-  Storing data in the Cookie header using popular  
cookie keywords is a technique that fox-it also 
observed in the highly sophisticated Regin

6.1  Installer communication
The installer makes use of one hardcoded domain which is 
only used during installation. By using a domain for installation 
purposes only, the other domains used for command and  
control traffic won’t be discovered as easily. This also means 
that taking down this domain would not impact the current 
botnet size, but only cause a minor hiccup in new infected 
machines being able to talk back to the Ponmocup backend. 
This one time has only been changed a couple of times; ‘faster-
nation.net’ has been the static installation domain since 2012.

Data is RC4 encrypted using a random 16 bytes key and 
encoded with a custom base64 table.
Before base64 encoding, Ponmocup first places the RC4 
key on top of the data, calculates the CRC32 of the data 
and places this value at the end of data. After decryption, 
every block of data has the CRC32 value of that block at 
the end (last 4 bytes)15.

A typical Ponmocup check-in would look something  
like this:

Cookie: uid=referringpath=0tMNPEubad4AlBaw4aZNqYj-PphJ-NCN5PRz4F_zJTxwoqhGOhK; clogid=

6.2 Main module communication
For continuous communication four hardcoded domains 
are, again, used to calculate the iP of the command and 
control server. Ponmocup resolves two domains at a time, 
the first calculated iP is used to send data to, the second 
is resolved as a back-up in case the first iP cannot be 
reached. To prevent the botnet from being taken down, 
two of the four hardcoded domains are changed every 
periodically12 by updating the main module, as shown in 
Figure 12. By regularly rotating these domains for the past 
4 years, all the Ponmocup bots are now load balanced 
between more than 10 domains.

6.3 Plug-in communication
Plug-ins capable of communicating with command and 
control servers use dedicated domains which calculate 
iP addresses for proxies that log to separate back-end 
servers.

‰“.€(cid:4)”.€‰’.(cid:5)(cid:4)

Although all plug-ins RC4 encrypt (exfiltrated) data, 
the RC4 key can differ. The cookie header is still used by  
plug-ins to exfiltrate basic information such as counters 
or checksums, but the exfiltration of larger data is done 
via (encrypted) PoSt requests.

To take down the botnet, one would had to have analyzed 
every Ponmocup payload, in intervals of 2–6 months, 
for 4 years straight; a time consuming task given the 
complexity of the malware.

The encryption routine used by the main module for 
command and control traffic is identical to the installer.

7  Anti-analysis techniques

One of the reasons Ponmocup has been able to stay under the radar, 
for as long as it has, is related to the different methods the malware 
uses to thwart analysis attempts. 

By specifically and heuristically checking for network 
and host based analysis tools, debuggers and virtualized  
environments, and then delivering a fake payload, the  
operators aim to prevent their malware from being 
detected by the security industry.

7.2 Delivery of fake payload
If one of the anti-analysis checks triggers, implying 
an attempt to analyze the malware, a flag is set and 
Ponmocup goes on to use one of its most clever tricks; 
delivery of a fake payload, as explained in Figure 13.

7.1  Checks for signs of analysis
Ponmocup’s anti-analysis checks are performed during 
installation, but most Ponmocup components perform 
anti-analysis checks separately. The main module, for 
example, performs anti-analysis checks every time a 
victim’s machine is rebooted, and plug-ins perform similar 
checks individually when they are executed. The table 
below lists a number of anti-analysis checks, some of 
which are less common:

Where typical malware employing anti-analysis imme-
diately exits if being analyzed, Ponmocup installs 
SanctionedMedia; a pay per install software bundle, 
which merely injects advertisements into webpages, 
commonly classified as adware. Because an analyst  
still observes an actual payload being dropped, the fake 
malware sample will often be analyzed. As this fake  
payload does nothing more than inject advertisements 
and is relatively easy to remove, it will generally not be 
of much interest to analysts or anti-virus companies.  
This fake payload is a simple, yet highly effective, disguise 
for a payload that poses a far more serious threat.

The fake payload is also installed onto a system in a far 
more obvious manner than the real payload, appearing in 
the process list as an exe, of which the name is derived 
from a random file in the system directory with 2–3 
random characters appended, with the file description 
‘RecSave’, product name ‘MyPCProtect’ and original 
file name ‘Smad.exe’. This payload is written in .NET, 
as opposed to the traditional C++ used in the actual 
Ponmocup framework.

the installation of the real or fake malware

a simple, yet highly 
effective, disguise  
for a payload that 
poses a far more 
serious threat.

If Ponmocup catches an analyst, the fingerprint of the system will immediately  
be blacklisted, after which this specific fingerprint and corresponding iP can never 
get infected with the malware again.
Ponmocup blacklists more than a 1000 iP ranges. Some of these ranges have been 
put on this blacklist preemptively and some have been blacklisted because they were 
observed analyzing the malware. The iP ranges on this blacklist belong to anti-virus 
and threat intelligence companies as well as large banks in various countries.
