EP14 Show Notes: 
We haven’t gone around the table and introduced ourselves in some time (about 50k downloads ago), so we take the time we usually complain about things at the top of the show to do that. We have seen a massive amount of “top-tier” threats in the last six months or so.  While it might seem like comparing apples and oranges (hint: it is), the crew takes a stab at ranking these recent threats/attacks: CCleaner, Deloitte, Equifax, Nyetya, SEC, Shamoon2, WannaCry.  Shockingly, all of us have a different ranking.  What’s your list look like?


Regarding response: Consistency matters, don’t be clever.  We discuss some recent unbelievably boneheaded things we have seen in security response.  More importantly, we discuss how one SHOULD respond to an incident.


Remember: Complexity kills. Unfortunately, it doesn’t kill thought leaders.
