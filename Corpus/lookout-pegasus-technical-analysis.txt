Executive Summary 

T

his report is an in-depth technical look at a targeted espionage attack being actively leveraged against an 
undetermined number of mobile users around the world. Lookout researchers have done deep analysis on
a live iOS sample of the malware, detailed in this report. Citizen Lab’s investigation links the software and 

 infrastructure to that of NSO Group which offers a product called Pegasus solution. Pegasus is professionally developed 
and highly advanced in its use of zero-day vulnerabilities, code obfuscation, and encryption. It uses sophisticated func-
tion hooking to subvert OS- and application-layer security in voice/audio calls and apps including Gmail, Facebook, 
WhatsApp, Facetime, Viber, WeChat, Telegram, Apple’s built-in messaging and email apps, and others. It steals the victim’s 
contact list and GPS location, as well as personal, Wi-Fi, and router passwords stored on the device. The iOS version of the 
attack uses what we refer to as Trident, an exploit of three related zero-day vulnerabilities in iOS, which Apple patched in 
iOS 9.3.5, available as of the publishing of this report.    

According to news reports, NSO Group sells weaponized software that targets mobile phones to governments and has 
been operating since 2010, according to its LinkedIn page. The Pegasus spyware has existed for a significant amount of 
time, and is advertised and sold for use on high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level espionage on 
iOS, Android, and Blackberry. 

This spyware is extremely sophisticated and modular, in addition to allowing customization. It uses strong encryption to 
protect itself from detection by traditional security tools and has a vigorous monitoring and self-destruct mechanism. 
Lookout’s analysis determined that the malware exploits three zero-day vulnerabilities, Trident, in Apple’s iOS:

1. CVE-2016-4657: Memory Corruption in WebKit - A vulnerability in Safari WebKit allows the attacker to compro-

mise the device when the user clicks on a link. 

2. CVE-2016-4655: Kernel Information Leak - A kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the 

attacker that allows him to calculate the kernel’s location in memory.

3. CVE-2016-4656: Kernel Memory corruption leads to Jailbreak - 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel-level vulnerabilities that 

allow the attacker to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software. 

The attack sequence begins with a simple phishing scheme: send a text (or Twitter or other type of) message with a 
benign-looking URL, user clicks on link, open web browser, load page, exploit a browser or operating system vulnerability, 
install software to gather information and to ensure that the software stays installed on the device (“persistence”). As soon 
as the targeted victim clicks the link, the attack occurs silently, with no indication to the user or device administrators that 
anything has occurred or that any new processes are running.

The Pegasus software is highly configurable: depending on the country of use and feature sets purchased by the user of 
the spyware, the surveillance capabilities include remotely accessing text messages, iMessages, calls, emails, logs, and 
more from apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, Facetime, Calendar, Line, Mail.Ru, WeChat,  
Surespot, Tango, Telegram, and others. 

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   3

Based on artifacts in the code, this spyware has been in the wild for more than two years. The exploits have configuration 
settings that go all the way back to iOS 7, which was released in 2013 and superseded in 2014.  

Pegasus takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available 
on mobile — always connected (WiFi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and 
contact lists. As a result of its functional modularity, the breadth of communications and user data it monitors, and the tai-
lored methods it instruments into other applications to exfiltrate data from them, to date, Pegasus is the most sophisticat-
ed privately-developed attack Lookout has encountered on a mobile endpoint. It hooks into widely used secure messen-
ger applications to copy cleartext data out of them before the user’s app can encrypt and send it. From the perspective 
of the user and the people they’re communicating with, their communications are secure, while the administrator of the 
Pegasus instance has secretly intercepted the clear text of their communication. Pegasus carries a high price tag averaging at 
over $25,000 per target. In at least one instance, NSO Group sold 300 licenses for $8 million USD.1

This report presents the technical details of the attack from the beginning of the exploit chain to the end. It includes  
analysis of the Trident zero-day iOS vulnerabilities that the toolkit was using to jailbreak the phone. We also look in-depth 
at the components of the espionage software, and have exposed the type of capabilities that an advanced mobile attack-
er using this software possesses.

Trident (the vulnerabilities disclosed in coordination with this report) were present in the latest versions of iOS, up to iOS 
9.3.4, the latest iOS version as of August 2016 when we made these discoveries. Researchers from Lookout and Citizen 
Lab responsibly disclosed the exploits and their related vulnerabilities to Apple. Given the severity of Trident,  
Apple worked extremely quickly to patch these vulnerabilities and has released iOS 9.3.5 to address them. With the 
release of the patched OS, we are publishing the technical details of the attack and exploits.

Background

As mobile phones continue to be tightly integrated into our personal and work lives, malicious actors are actively creating 
sophisticated applications that can run on victims’ devices without either their knowledge of the threat’s presence, or of 
the actors’ intent. This can be seen in the diversity of threats that target mobile devices: from those that are financially mo-
tivated, such as adware, banking trojans, and SMS fraud, to those seeking personal information or corporate intellectual 
property. Spyware, a malicious application designed to retrieve specific information from an infected device without the 
victim’s knowledge, falls into the latter camp.

Spyware applications often include the ability to extract a victim’s SMS messages, contact details, record their calls, 
access their call logs, or remotely activate a device’s microphone and camera to surreptitiously capture audio, video, 
and image content.

In addition to these rich features, some spyware also has the equally important ability to remotely deliver the malicious 
application to a target device. This is a complex and technically challenging problem, as evidenced by the amount of 
money private security firms and corporate bug bounty programs pay for zero-day exploits that facilitate this remote 
delivery. 

Two private security firms, Gamma Group and Hacking Team, both made headlines after media outlets revealed that the 
organizations developed mobile surveillance software that has been sold to oppressive governments. These products are 
often very expensive and generally only accessible to well-funded attackers given the complexity involved in creating this 
kind of mobile spyware, and the fact that it includes zero-day exploits. 

The Israeli based NSO Group has managed to avoid the spotlight of the cyber security community despite being in oper-
ation for over five years. Founded in 2010 by Niv Carmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group has publicly stated that 
it develops and sells mobile phone surveillance software to governments around the world. It has claimed that its surveil-
lance capability is undetectable with one of the founders stating, “We’re a complete ghost.” 2 Private equity firm Francisco 
Partners acquired NSO Group in 2014 for $110 million. The founders of NSO Group play in both the cyber offense and 
defense spaces, having also founded the mobile security company Kaymera.3

Disclosure Timeline

Citizen Lab reported the existence of the malware to Lookout on August 12, 2016. Lookout and Citizen Lab worked 
together to analyze the software and attempt to determine the severity of the vulnerabilities and the capabilities of the 
malware until August 15, 2016 when we reported the information to Apple.

The three organizations worked together from August 15, 2016 to the release of the vulnerability patches in iOS 9.3.5 on 
August 25, 2016.

Attack Overview 

The attack is very simple in its delivery and silent in delivering its payload. The attack starts when the attacker sends a 
website URL (through SMS, email, social media, or any other message) to an identified target. The user only has to take 
one action--click on the link. Once the user clicks the link, the software silently carries out a series of exploits against the 
victim’s device to remotely jailbreak it so that the espionage software packages can be installed. The user’s only indication 
that anything happened will be that the browser closes after the link is clicked.

The espionage software contains malicious code, processes, and apps that are used to spy, collect data, and report back 
what the user does on the device. This spyware can access and exfiltrate messages, calls, emails, logs, and more from 
apps including, but not limited to:

Facetime

CVE-2016-4657  
Exploit against Safari

Two kernel exploits  
(CVE-2016-4655  
& CVE-2016-4656)  
jailbreak the device

1. Persistence and stealth monitoring

2. Establishes communication 
to Command & Control 
Infrastructure

3. Hooks all communication 
and starts stealing data

In order to accomplish this, the spyware, once it jailbreaks the user’s phone, does not download malicious versions of 
these apps to the victim’s device in order to capture data, rather it compromises the original apps already installed on the 
device. This includes pre-installed apps such as Facetime and Calendar and those from the official App Store. 

Usually, iOS security mechanisms prevent normal apps from spying on each other, but spying “hooks” can be installed 
on a jailbroken device. Pegasus takes advantage of both the remote jailbreak exploit and a technique called “hooking.” 
The hooking is accomplished by inserting Pegasus’ dynamic libraries into the legitimate processes running on the device. 
These dynamic libraries can be used to hook the apps using a framework called Cydia Mobile Substrate, known to the 
iOS jailbreak community, and which Pegasus uses as part of the exploit.

A user infected with this spyware is under complete surveillance by the attacker because, in addition to the apps listed 
above, it also spies on: 
Phone calls
Call logs
SMS messages the victim sends or receives

•  Audio and video communications that (in the words a founder of NSO Group) turns the phone into a “walkie-talkie”4

Access to this content could be used to gain further access into other accounts owned by the target, such as banking, 
email, and other services he/she may use on or off the device.

The attack is comprised of three separate stages that contain both the exploit code and the espionage software. The 
stages are sequential; each stage is required to successfully decode, exploit, install, and run the subsequent stage. 
Each stage leverages one of the Trident vulnerabilities in order to run successfully.

STAGE 1   Delivery and WebKit vulnerability: This stage comes down over the initial URL in the form of an 
HTML file (1411194s) that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2016-4657) in WebKit (used in Safari and other browsers). 

STAGE 2   Jailbreak: This stage is downloaded from the first stage code based on the device type (32-bit vs 64-
bit). Stage 2 is downloaded as an obfuscated and encrypted package. Each package is encrypted with unique keys 
at each download, making traditional network-based controls ineffective. It contains the code that is needed to 
exploit the iOS Kernel (CVE-2016-4655 and CVE-2016-4656) and a loader that downloads and decrypts a package 
for stage 3.

STAGE 3  Espionage software: This stage is downloaded by stage 2 and is also based on the device type (32-bit 
vs 64-bit). Stage 3 contains the espionage software, daemons, and other processes that are used after the de-
vice has been jailbroken in stage 2. Stage 3 installs  the hooks into the applications the attacker wishes to spy on. 
Additionally, stage 3 detects if the device was previously jailbroken through another method and, if so, removes 
any access to the device that the jailbreak provides, such as via SSH. The software also contains a failsafe to remove 
itself if certain conditions are present.

The third stage deploys a number of files deployed in a standard unix tarball (test222.tar), each of which has its own pur-
pose (that we describe later in this report):

The attack we investigated works  on iOS up to 9.3.4. The developers maintain a large table in their code that attacks 
all iOS versions from 7.0 up to and including iOS 9.3.3. While the code we investigated did not contain the appropriate 
values to initially work on iOS 9.3.4, the exploits we investigated would still work, and it is trivial for the attackers to update 
the table so that the attack will work on 9.3.4.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   8

One other unique property of this attack is that standard jailbreak detections fail to report that the device has been ex-
ploited. The attack and installation of the spying software is designed to be as silent as possible to the target.

Professional Grade Development
Pegasus is well designed in terms of its modularity and efficiency. For example, the kernel exploits call upon magic tables 
for each of the platforms that map out kernel memory for each version and phone model. The mapping for iOS 9.2.1 on 
the iPhone 6 is shown here: 

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   9

Note that each function location in memory (as an offset from the base of the kernel) is mapped.  Each of these will be 
used later in the kernel version. 

Additionally, the code is extremely modular, relative to other malware our researchers have encountered. We found com-
mon libraries and common formats with similar naming conventions. For example, the libwacalls (WhatsApp Call Library) 
and libvbcalls (Viber Call Library) use similar formats with similar function names and common standards. Unlike most 
malware authors, the code in Pegasus is clean and efficient, with evidence of professional and careful design.

Finally, we see evidence of a robust quality assurance process for their development: even their first stage exploit con-
tains both debugging and QA-specific functions of the type one would expect from an enterprise-class software develop-
ment organization.

Evolution of Software
The malware has been in operation for well over a year, which has enabled it to develop a degree of software maturity, 
and as a result it is capable of exploiting multiple iOS versions. An excerpt from the magic table that maps addresses in 
the kernel shows that the exploit supports versions of the phone from the iPhone 4s up to the iPhone 6s Plus.

The kernel exploit includes checks that indicate that the exploit works against iOS 7 (which was released in 013):

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   10

The Trident Vulnerabilities

The software contains multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, referred to here as Trident, used against iOS 9.3.3, each of which would have 
worked against current 9.3.4 as of the date of discovery. With the 9.3.5 patches, these vulnerabilities will no longer work.

CVE-2016-4657: Memory Corruption in Safari WebKit
A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Safari WebKit that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Pegasus ex-
ploits this vulnerability to obtain initial code execution privileges within the context of the Safari web browser.

This vulnerability is complex and Lookout continues to work on analyzing this vulnerability and will publish additional 
findings as they become available.

CVE-2016-4655: Kernel Information Leak Circumvents KASLR
Before Pegasus can execute its jailbreak, it must determine where the kernel is located in memory. Kernel Address Space 
Layout Randomization (KASLR) makes this task difficult by  mapping the kernel into different and unpredictable locations 
in memory.  In short, before attacking the kernel, Pegasus has to find it.

The attacker has found a way to locate the kernel by using a function call that leaks a non-obfuscated kernel memory 
address in the return value, allowing the kernel’s actual memory location to be mapped.

CVE-2016-4656: Memory Corruption in Kernel leads to Jailbreak
The third vulnerability in Pegasus’ Trident is the one that is used to jailbreak the phone. A memory corruption vulnerability 
in the kernel is used to corrupt memory in both the 32- and 64-bit versions.   The exploits are performed differently on 
each version.

This vulnerability is complex and Lookout continues to work on analyzing this vulnerability and will publish additional 
findings as they become available.

Jailbreak Persistence
Once the kernel has been exploited, both exploits perform similar tasks to prepare the system to be jailbroken: 
• Disable kernel security protections including code signing
•
•
• Write the jailbreak files (including the main loader as /sbin/mount_nfs)

Remount the system partition
Clear the Safari caches (to help cover their tracks)

As a final step of stage 2, the exploit removes /etc/nfs.conf which triggers the file to load /sbin/mount_nfs (which is the 
stage 3 jailbreakloader). Because /sbin/mount_nfs is run as root, the code is run with full privileges.

After stage 3 will be unpacked, Pegasus need to gain persistence on device reboot. So exploit replaces the system 
dae-mon rtbuddyd with a copy of the jsc binary and creates a link to ascript that is similar to the exploit for 
CVE-2016-4657, which we will describe later.

Spyware Analysis 

Pegasus is one of the most sophisticated pieces of surveillance and espionage software that Lookout has investigated. It 
has a novel mechanism to install and hide itself and obtain persistence on the system. Once it is resident, it uses a num-
ber of ways to hide its communications and protect itself from discovery, and it hooks into a large number of the phone’s 
functions in order to gather data and intercept messages and calls.

Installation and Persistence
The spyware is installed during the stage 3 execution by running the lw-install binary. Lw-install sets up a few of the key 
structures of the product, as well as establishes persistence across reboots (and has a few protective functions to ensure 
that the software doesn’t accidentally brick the phone).

The first thing that lw-install does is check the iOS version; it runs different commands depending on whether it is running 
on iOS 9 or a previous version.   

If it is installed on iOS 9, lw-install runs “/sbin/launchctl load” on .plist files dropped into /Library/LaunchDaemons (which 

is normally empty or used to hold launchd plists for jailbroken services, such as sshd).  This will ensure that these files get 

launched and started on reboot.  

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   12

If the OS is not iOS 9, the first thing that lw-install does is remove the following files:

Then it starts

Note that lw_install appears to log to /private/var/wireless/Library/com.apple.wifid.r.log 

Persistence: JSC Privilege Escalation
Pegasus implements its persistence mechanism through the use of a developer tool called “jsc” that is part of the iOS 
environment.  Jsc is intended to allow users to execute javascript using the WebKit engine outside the context of a web 
browser.6  In this case, a memory corruption issue in the tool is used by Pegasus to attain persistence.

As part of the installation process for persistence, the daemon rtbuddyd is replaced by a copy of jsc (which is a signed 
binary and allowed to run code).  On device reboot rtbuddyd will run and  load --early-boot, which is a link to the 
com.apple.itunesstored.2.cstore file. The com.apple.itunesstored.2.csstore file is structured similarly to the exploit 
for CVE-2016-4657.  This loads shellcode which is used to re-exploit the kernel each time that the system is rebooted and 
start the running daemons. The execution flow of this code is:

• 
• 
• 
• 

Run the jsc script calling --early-boot
Run the exploit that maps the kernel base 
Run the kernel  exploit
Spawn the main running daemons of Pegasus: systemd, watchdogd 

As Citizen Lab mentioned in their report, Pegasus puts its own protection above all else. From the manual, as quoted by 
Citizen Lab: 

In general, we understand that it is more important that the source will not be exposed and the target will suspect 
nothing than keeping the agent alive and working.

To this end, Pegasus has a large number of features that enable it to maintain its secrecy. It constantly monitors the phone 
for status and disables any other access to the phone by previous/other jailbreaking software. Pegasus also contains a 
complex self-destruct mechanism which completely removes it from the phone. 

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   14

Disabling Updates
The Stage 3 loader ensures that the phone won’t receive auto-updates going forward: 

Jailbreak Detection

The stage 3 loader also checks the device to see if it had been previously jailbroken:

The software also checks during each startup: 

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   15

Device Monitoring 

In order to maintain its ability to run, communicate and monitor its own status, the software disables the phone’s “Deep 
Sleep” functionality: 

6  https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JSC

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   16

The software also keeps a close eye on the battery status of the current device:

Additionally, the software monitors the current connection state and tracks which types of networks the phone is connect-
ed to, potentially in order to determine the bandwidth and ability to send full data across the network: 

Stealth Update to Command & Control Infrastructure
The software has multiple stealth communication channels. The systemd binary that Pegasus employs appears to use SMS 

Despite appearing as a legitimate password reset from Google, this message actually contains an instruction for Pegasus 
to update the command and control servers that it can communicate to. It appears Pegasus is capable of receiving five 
types of instructions via SMS, with the instruction ID determined based on the last number of the verification code. For 
example, in the message above this is 9.  

This functionality appears to allow Pegasus to be updated out of band if http or https was not available. In the event C2 
infrastructure was taken down or unavailable, this functionality provides Pegasus with a lifeline to the actors controlling it 
with instructions on where to find the new C2 servers.  This functionality is unprecedented in spyware and provides the 
ability for Pegasus to persist even when infrastructure is compromised or taken down.

tically. An example of an attacker-provided instruction via SMS (captured originally by Citizen Lab) can be seen below.

Self Destruction

The Pegasus software has a highly sensitive self-destruct mechanism to ensure that the product is not discovered.  
When the software appears to be threatened, it will self destruct, removing its persistence mechanism (removing the 
cloned rtbuddyd and exploit com.apple.itunesstored.2.csstore described above).
Pegasus will also remove all of its libraries (for example, the audio recording tools):

Data Gathering
As Pegasus’ fundamental purpose is to spy on the owner of the phone, one of its main operations is to gather data.   
The data- gathering functionality of Pegasus is among the most complete and comprehensive we have seen in any spy-
ware package. It gathers everything from obvious high-value data like passwords, contacts, and calendar entries to data 
from numerous social networks.  The full list of data types gathered is long, so we will examine only how it grabs certain 
pieces of high- value data in order to show how the product works.

GPS location 
Pegasus also constantly updates and sends the location of the phone:

Capturing User Passwords

WiFi and Router Passwords
In addition to stealing all of the victim’s passwords, Pegasus interrogates the list of every Wi-Fi network that the phone has 
saved and grabs all of the SSIDs and WEP/WAP keys and users. 

Pegasus also grabs the router password for Apple devices like Airport, Time Capsule, etc.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   22

Interception of Calls and Messages
Pegasus has a sophisticated set of audio and messaging intercept libraries that are modular and extensible.  The base 
libraries for audio (libaudio.dylib) and messaging (libimo.dylib) are comprehensive, but there are specialized libraries for 
each of the key intercept protocols.

The libaudio library registers a number of notification observers that record audio when fired. These observers listen for 
notification IDs that get posted by various Pegasus modules. In the analyzed sample, this included notifications from the 
WhatsApp and Viber modules (, libwacalls.dylib and libvbcalls.dylib).

The libaudio library registers a number of notification observers that record audio when fired. These observers listen for 
notification IDs that get posted by various Pegasus modules. In the analyzed sample, this included notifications from the 
WhatsApp and Viber modules (, libwacalls.dylib and libvbcalls.dylib).

Process Injection: converter 
The interception of real-time calls from the chat messengers (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber) comes through a library that is inject-
ed into their process space dynamically at run time. The “converter” binary (the mechanism through which this occurs) is a 
version of the cynject open-source library available here:  https://github.com/r-plus/substrate/blob/master/cynject.cpp

The library takes a pid as an argument and injects a dylib into running process using Mach kernel APIs. The usage for converter 
is: start (usage: %s <pid> <dylib> [args...])

Converter has the following entitlements:
<key>com.apple.springboard.debugapplications</key>
<true/>
<key>get-task-allow</key>
<true/>
<key>task_for_pid-allow</key>
<true/>

Additionally, converter has a failsafe key combination that it listens for on the keyboard to dynamically unload the injected 
libraries.

Skype 
Pegasus pulls all of the data about calls out of the Skype database on the device.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   24

Pegasus also saves any calls that Skype has previously recorded by reading them out of the Skype database files.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF PEGASUS SPYWARE  |   25

Telegram 

WhatsApp
The Pegasus authors have instrumented the interception of WhatsApp messages and calls within the samples that we have ob-
tained. In addition to logging the appropriate information for messages and calls, the software also loads a library (libwacalls.
dylib) that is designed to hook key WhatsApp functions and intercept various communication types.

This library issues system-wide notifications when calls are connected, interrupted, or ended, and when another call event 
occurs. Any application can receive these events provided they know the ID of the notification. Throughout Pegasus these 
notifications are unique and conspicuous, and they are made up of a sequence that’s 56 characters long and appears to be the 
output of a sha224 hash function. Another Pegasus module responsible for recording audio included notification observers 
that explicitly listen for these IDs. It seems that when these notifications are sent from libwacalls, and consequently handled by 
libaudio.dylib, Pegasus records the current WhatsApp call a victim is making.
Libaudio saves audio recordings from WhatsApp calls in the following directories:

•  micFileName - /private/var/tmp/cr/x.<call_id>.caf
•

libwacalls first checks that Cydia Mobile substrate exists by attempting to load and link /usr/lib/libdata.dylib. If it isn’t present 
then libwacalls exits. Otherwise execution continues, resulting in the decryption of several strings that are used to identify class-
es and methods to be hooked.

Libwacalls is responsible for hooking the following methods that belong to the CallManager class:

•  setCallConnected
•  setCallInterrupted
•  setCallInterruptedByPeer
•  endCall

The following method is also hooked that belongs to the CallLogger class:

•  addCallEvent

All hooks rely on distributed notifications for IPC. As a result all hooks post a system-wide notification, with each notification 
containing a unique identifier that notification observers must reference exactly in order to receive. In all cases notification IDs 
are 56 characters, likely a sha224 hash digest. The functionality of these hooks is as follows:

Viber
The samples of Pegasus we obtained were configured to obtain all of the calls from Viber through the libvbcalls library, which 
provides hooks for Viber.  These hooks are implemented similar to the ways seen in the libwacalls dynamic library, where hook-
ing of key WhatsApp functions occur. Hooking in libvbcalls takes place when calls are first started and when they finish.

CallEnded hooking logs the time the call finished and posts it in a system wide notification.

The following notification IDs are posted by libvbcalls:

• 
• 

onCallStarted : eb899b6873eb166859e610915dd002ea21b6057bd31fc6c1b38f27e2
onCallEnded : b79cd49420fbeba629a0290bc890c66924dd8452d0c2fd5ba9b327d0

As with libwacalls these notifications are picked up by libaudio.dylib and appear to result in call recording taking place.

Libaudio also saves audio recordings of ViberCalls to the following directories. These are the same as those used by WhatsApp 
except for the sentryFileName. All three paths are listed below.

•  micFileName - /private/var/tmp/cr/x.<call_id>.caf
spkFileName - /private/var/tmp/cr/t.<call_id>.caf
• 
• 
sentryFileName - /private/var/tmp/cr/vb.<call_id>.caf

Real-Time Espionage
In addition to the ability to grab all the input and output of the phone, the phone can be used as an audio and video recorder. 
As Omri Lavie, NSO’s co-founder, told the Financial Times, “Your smartphone today is the new walkie-talkie.”7 These functions 
are on display below:

Conclusion 

We rely on mobile devices to both store our digital assets and give us access to them. Our phones are always with us 
and have become a main form of voice, video- and messaging-based communication. This makes our mobile devices 
highly valuable targets for motivated attackers.

NSO Group reportedly has hundreds of employees and makes millions of dollars in annual revenue, effectively as 
a cyber arms dealer, from the sale of its sophisticated mobile attack software. NSO is only one example of this type 
of cyber mercenary: we know that it is not the only one, as we’ve seen with the Hacking Team, Finfisher, and other 
organizations that compete in this space. 

While this report is focused on the iOS version of the software, Lookout and Citizen Lab are aware that NSO Group  
advertises Android and Blackberry versions and are investigating those as well.

This report shows the importance of keeping our devices up to date with the latest patches and exercising vigilance  
with the security of our mobile devices.
