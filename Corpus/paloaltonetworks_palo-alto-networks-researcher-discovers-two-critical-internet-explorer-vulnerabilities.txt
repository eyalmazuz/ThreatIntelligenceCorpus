Palo Alto Networks Researcher Discovers Two Critical Internet Explorer Vulnerabilities

Palo Alto Networks researcher Bo Qu discovered two new critical Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerabilities affecting IE versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Both are included in Microsoft’s July 2015 Security Bulletin, and documented in Microsoft Security Bulletins MS15-065 and MS15-066.
In our continuing commitment to the security research community, these vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft through our participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) program, which ensures the timely, responsible disclosure of new vulnerabilities and creation of protections from security vendors.
Palo Alto Networks is a regular contributor to vulnerability research. Previous critical IE vulnerability discoveries from the past year included three in June, three in May, one in March, five in February (revised from three), three in November 2014, one in October 2014, 15 in September 2014,  three in August 2014, 10 in July 2014, and 22 in June 2014 (revised from 21).
By proactively identifying these vulnerabilities, developing protections for our customers, and sharing them with Microsoft for patching, we are removing one weapon used by attackers to compromise enterprise and government networks.
