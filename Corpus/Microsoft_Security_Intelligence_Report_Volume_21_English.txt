About this report 

The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software 
vulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software. 
Past reports and related resources are available for download at 
www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and 
guidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their 
organizations, software, and users. 

Reporting period 

This volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and 
second quarters of 2016, with trend data for the last several quarters presented 
on a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent 
from quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of 
the year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly 
basis. 

Throughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced 
using the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n 
indicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H16 represents the first half of 2016 
(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q15 represents the fourth quarter of 2015 
(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting 
period or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report. 

Conventions 

This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming 
standard for families and variants of malware. For information about this 
standard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 135. In this 
report, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is 
considered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes 
threats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common 
industry practices, such as generic and cloud-based detections. For the 
purposes of this report, a threat is defined as a malicious or unwanted software 
family or variant that is detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.

How to use this report 

The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report has been released twice a year since 
2006. Each volume is based upon data collected from millions of computers all 
over the world, which not only provides valuable insights on the worldwide 
threat landscape, both at home and at work, but also provides detailed 
information about threat profiles faced by computer users in more than a 
hundred individual countries and regions. 

To get the most out of each volume, Microsoft recommends the following: 

Read 

Each volume of the report consists of several parts. The primary report typically 
consists of a worldwide threat assessment, one or more feature articles, 
guidance for mitigating risk, and some supplemental information. A summary of 
the key findings in the report can be downloaded and reviewed separately from 
the full report; it highlights a number of facts and subjects that are likely to be of 
particular interest to readers. The regional threat assessment, available for 
download and in interactive form at www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat, 
provides individual summaries of threat statistics and security trends for more 
than 100 countries and regions worldwide. 

Reading the volume in its entirety will provide readers with the most benefit and 
context, but the report is designed to provide value in small doses as well. Take 
a few minutes to review the summary information to find the information that 
will be of most interest to you and your organization. Consult the table of 
contents and the index to learn more about particular topics of interest.

Microsoft also encourages readers to share each released volume, or its 
download link, with co-workers, peers, and friends with similar interests. The 
Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is written to be useful and accessible to a 
wide range of audiences. Each volume contains thousands of hours of research 
disseminated in easy to understand language, with advanced technical jargon 
kept to a minimum. Each section and article is written and reviewed to provide 
the most value for the time it takes to read. 

vi  HOW TO USE THIS REPORT  
 

 

Assess your own risk 

Reading about the threats and risks that affect different types of environments 
presents a good opportunity to assess your own risks. Not every computer and 
entity faces the same risk from all threats. Assess your own risks and determine 
which topics and information can help you to best defend against the most 
significant risks. 

The volume and scope of threats facing the typical organization make it 
important to prioritize. The greatest risk to any computer or organization is 
posed by currently and recently active threats. Pay attention to the threats that 
have most commonly affected your region or industry, focusing particularly on 
the most common successful attacks in the wild that cause the most problems. 
Give less consideration to very rare or theoretical-only attacks, unless your 
computers are at particular risk for such threats. 

Educate 

Microsoft strives to make this report one of the most valuable sources of threat 
and mitigation information that you can read and share. We encourage you to 
use the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report as a guide to educate your

2  HOW TO USE THIS REPORT  
 

 

Protecting cloud 
infrastructure: Detecting and 
mitigating threats using 
Azure Security Center 

Cloud computing introduces new challenges to security organizations of all 
sizes. Enterprise IT teams have established policies and procedures designed for 
enterprise infrastructure and applications, based on their decades of security 
experience dealing with on-premises threats. Many of these policies and 
procedures can be used effectively in public and hybrid cloud environments. 
However, security teams need to keep abreast of changes in the threat 
landscape brought on by the emergence of cloud computing. 

Threats against cloud deployments and infrastructure 

New types of threats can be related to characteristics of the public cloud only, or 
to issues introduced by connectivity between on-premises environments and 
the public cloud. The following subsections provide descriptions of some new 
types of threats. 

Disclosing secrets on public sites  

Public code repositories such as GitHub have become very popular with 
developers because they enable easy collaboration and source control and 
remove the responsibility for maintaining the repository infrastructure from 
developers. But public repositories can be a double-edged sword. Documented 
cases exist of developers accidentally publishing secret keys on GitHub and 
other public code repositories, which were discovered by attackers and used to 
compromise cloud services. Such incidents can sometimes give attackers access 
to a service’s entire account/subscription database, or allow them to misuse its 
compute resources for malicious purposes. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   3 

Pivot back attacks 

A pivot back attack occurs when an attacker compromises a public cloud 
resource to obtain information that they then use to attack the resource 
provider’s on-premises environment. Public facing endpoints in the cloud are 
often under constant brute force attack through protocols such as Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH). Although the overwhelming 
majority of these attacks fail, a very small percentage of them succeed. When 
they do, an attacker can sometimes find sensitive information in unexpected or 
obscure places.  

Targeted attacks 
against on-
premises and 
cloud infra-
structures often 
focus on IT 
administrators. 

For example, they could find such secrets in a Bash session 
history or a text file in the root directory of the virtual machine’s 
desktop. Such information can be used to access resources such 
as databases, SharePoint sites, and cloud storage. If left 
unimpeded, an attacker could continue gathering information 
that could provide greater access to the enterprise infrastructure 
and data. 

Attacks against cloud administrators 

Targeted attacks against on-premises and cloud infrastructures 
alike often focus on IT administrators. The intent is to take 

control of an email account that has a high probability of containing credentials 
that can be used to gain access to the public cloud administrator portal. 

After logging into the administrator portal, an attacker can gather information 
and make changes to gain access to other cloud-based resources, execute 
ransomware, or even pivot back to the on-premises environment, as explained 
earlier.  

Man in the Cloud (MitC) attacks 

Another new threat is posed by what the security company Imperva has dubbed 
“Man in the Cloud,” or MitC attacks,1 In which an attacker induces a prospective 
victim to install a piece of malware using a typical mechanism, such as an email 
with a link to a malicious website. After the malware is downloaded and installed,

it finds a cloud storage folder on the user’s computer. It then switches out the 
user’s cloud storage synchronization token with the attacker’s token. 

After the token switch, the attacker will receive copies of each file the user places 
in cloud storage, which effectively makes the attacker a “man in the middle” for 
cloud storage. One of the attacker’s advantages in this threat scenario is that the 
malware is removed after the token is switched out, which makes it harder to 
detect the compromise. 

Side-channel attacks 

In a side-channel attack, an attacker attempts to put a virtual machine on the 
same physical server as the intended victim. If such a successful co-location can 
be achieved, the attacker will be able to launch local attacks against the victim. 
These attacks might include local DDoS, network sniffing, and man-in-the-
middle attacks, all of which can be used to extract information. 

It should be noted that side-channel attacks are not trivial. Microsoft Azure 
employs a number of obfuscation methodologies to significantly decrease the 
chances of such an attack succeeding.  

Resource ransom 

Ransomware is well-known in the desktop operating system space. This malware 
restricts access to components of an operating system or to files stored on disk, 
typically through encryption, and demands that the victim pay the attacker to 
get the keys required to restore access. 

Attackers have made similar attempts to hold cloud resources hostage by 
breaking in to a prospective victim’s public cloud account using any one of a 
number of methods, including some of the methods discussed in this section. 
When they have control of the account, the attackers attempt to encrypt or 
otherwise restrict access to as many cloud resources as possible. The attackers 
then require the victim to pay the ransom to release the restricted resources. 

The challenge for the attacker is to inform the victim that the attack has taken 
place, and how to pay the ransom. Because servers usually don’t have signed in 
users, attackers need to use methods other than those used for desktop 
ransomware. One way an attacker can inform cloud resource ransom victims is 
through the use of bot technology, which presents another, and perhaps 
unexpected, use case for the new and growing ecosystem of bot technologies. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   5 

Cloud weaponization 

In the cloud weaponization threat scenario, an attacker establishes a foothold 
within a cloud infrastructure by compromising and taking control of a few virtual 
machines. The attacker can then use these virtual machines to attack, 
compromise, and control thousands of virtual machines – some within the same 
public cloud service provider as the initial attack, and others inside other public 
cloud service providers.  

Each of the compromised virtual machines has malware installed that establishes 
a backdoor connection to the attacker’s command and control servers, from 
which the attacker can issue commands to the thousands of compromised 
virtual machines to attack targets throughout the Internet.  

Cloud weaponization can be implemented in a number of ways using a variety 
of attacks, including SSH, RDP, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), unsolicited 
messaging (spamming), port scanning, and port sweeping.  

Azure actively monitors for cloud weaponization. Figure 1 shows the distribution 
of the outbound attacks discovered (and in many cases mitigated) by Azure 
Security Center’s advanced detection mechanisms.

from.

The cyber kill chain: On-premises and in the cloud 

The cyber kill chain is a model defined by analysts at Lockheed Martin to aid 
decision making with regard to detecting and responding to threats.2 This

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   7 

model has become very popular with IT security groups within both small and 
large IT organizations. It includes the following phases: 

  Reconnaissance. The attacker determines the best targets by probing a 

number of online and offline resources. 

  Weaponization. Files (such as documents) can be changed in ways to make 

them useful “weapons” against a target system and can also be used to 
enable installation of malicious code. 

  Delivery. Weaponized files are placed on the target.  

  Exploitation. Weaponized files are “detonated” to take advantage of 

weaknesses in the target operating system or applications. 

 

Installation. A back door mechanism is installed on the compromised device 
so that that the attacker has persistent access. 

  Command and control (C2). Malware on the compromised device 

communicates with a command-and-control system that provides the 
attacker with access to resources required to carry out actions.  

  Actions on objectives. The attacker moves forward to carry out objectives, 

which may be predefined, or evolve based on discovery. 

The cyber kill chain was defined at a time when cloud computing was still 
gaining traction and did not explicitly consider the some of the unique aspects 
of cloud computing. There are some differences in how to approach the various 
phases in the kill chain between on-premises and cloud computing scenarios.  

Figure 4 reformulates the cyber kill chain phases to make it easier to understand 
some of the differences in the cyber kill chain between on-premises and cloud 
environments.

Active reconnaissance 

During the active reconnaissance phase, the attacker learns about the intended 
victim to improve their chances of a successful attack. In the on-premises world, 
the attacker can take advantage of social networks to learn information about 
the target that can be used to induce the victim to download malware during 
the delivery phase.  

The same ruse isn’t as easy in the cloud. There’s no social 
network for servers and services to help the attacker learn 
more about them. The attacker must go through a time and 
effort-intensive process of scanning the network, doing port 
scans to discover devices, and then testing active service 
ports. All this activity provides the defender an opportunity 
for discovering the attacker’s activities. 

Active 
reconnaissance 
isn’t as easy in the 
cloud. 

Delivery 

The attacker places malware on the target during the delivery phase. In the on-
premises world, the attacker can create an email that has a malicious link to a 
website or include an attachment that leads to the installation of malicious code. 
Another option is to copy the malware onto a USB key and then place the USB 
key in a strategic location so that the intended target finds it. The victim then 
puts the USB key into their computer, which compromises it.  

In the public cloud, the attacker needs to deliver the malicious payload to a 
server. Because it’s unlikely to find a logged on user on a server to install 
malicious code, the attacker needs to find a way to gain direct access. One way 
to accomplish this is through a brute force attack. If such an attack is successful, 
the attacker will be able to place malware on the server.  

The defender has an opportunity to detect the malware on the server before the 
attacker moves on to the exploitation phase. 

Exploitation 

On-premises exploitation typically focuses on client-side vulnerabilities. In the 
public cloud the focus is on server-side vulnerabilities.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   9 

Persistence 

In most cases, attackers of client operating systems will use tools that persist on 
the compromised device by placing them on the local hard disk. Tools aren’t 
placed in memory because client computers reboot relatively often for system 
updates, policy changes, or even simple password changes or bug checks. 

In contrast, server uptime is much longer, which benefits attackers because they 
can load exploit code into memory and have the code persist for an extended 
period of time. Longer server uptime reduces the risk of detection because there 
is no persistent code on disk that’s easy to detect.  

Although traditional disk scanning techniques won’t find evidence of in-memory 
malware, defenders can use crash dump analysis to discover and examine 
malware that exists only in memory.  

Internal reconnaissance 

In many on-premises client attack scenarios, the attacker uses custom tools. 
Built-in toolsets are not as robust as those found on servers and therefore don’t 
meet their needs. 

Such custom toolsets aren’t seen very often in the cloud. Attackers take 
advantage of built-in admin tools, which are typically more powerful than what’s 
found on client operating systems. These built-in admin tools help attackers by 
reducing the risk of detection; they don’t need to place custom attack tools on 
disk. 

Because new attack tools aren’t being installed on cloud-based virtual machines, 
they can’t be detected with disk scanning techniques. Instead, defenders can use 
machine learning and behavioral analytics to differentiate between legitimate 
admin activity and malicious activity. 

Lateral movement 

Lateral movement across on-premises networks uses a machine (or virtual 
machine) pivot. Attackers move from machine to machine by obtaining 
increasingly privileged credentials as they expand outward. Tools such as 
mimikatz are used by attackers to harvest such credentials. 

The machine pivot isn’t currently the norm in the cloud. There are a number of 
reasons for this, such as the fact that tenants maintain a number of resource 

10  PROTECTING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE: DETECTING AND MITIGATING THREATS USING AZURE SECURITY CENTER  

 

 

islands in the cloud. Also, in most cases there is limited trust between the cloud 
and on-premises deployments.  

In the cloud, the primary pivot appears to cloud resources. 
For example, with resource pivoting, an attacker will 
compromise an IaaS virtual machine, find credentials for a 
storage service, where more credentials are discovered, 
some of which allow access to a SQL instance. The attacker 
hops services instead of virtual machines.  

Without powerful 
detection, there 
can be no 
response. 

This service hopping behavior enables the defender to focus on this type of 
activity and enables another avenue for detection.  

Countering threats with Azure Security Center Advanced Threat 
Detection 

Azure Security Center helps protect, detect, and respond to security threats 
against Azure cloud-based resources. Security Center provides protection by 
analyzing the security status of Azure resources and then providing 
recommendations on how to increase the level of security.  

Protection is just the first level. The ability to detect that an intrusion has taken 
place is critical. Without powerful detection, there can be no response. Azure 
Security Center uses advanced threat detection technologies and 
methodologies to detect threats that would have been very difficult to find prior 
to the advent of machine learning and big data.  

Azure Security Center uses a number of methods that work together to provide 
advanced threat detection. These methods include: 

  Atomic detections 

  Threat intelligence feeds 

  Behavioral analysis 

  Anomaly detection 

  Detection fusion 

Atomic detections 

Atomic detections are based on well-known malicious patterns that are 
consistent with indicators of compromise (IoC). These patterns are not subject to 
mutation, and therefore are considered unambiguous. They can be determined 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   11 

by a single entity, such as a single packet, single behavior, or single event 
(recorded in a log entry). This determination is similar to how an intrusion 
detection system (IDS) works, but instead of using on-the-wire packet analysis, 
atomic threat detection typically uses log entries. 

Atomic threat detection has a high return on investment because development 
overhead is relatively low. In addition, there is also a very low false positive rate. 
Most commodity malware can be found with atomic detections. 

A disadvantage of atomic detection is that it isn’t the best method for detecting 
more sophisticated attacks. Atomic detections are very threat specific, and so it 
is relatively easy for skilled attackers to evade them. However, this isn’t a 
problem because Azure Security Center uses a multi-tier detection strategy that 
provides the ability to detect attacks at multiple levels. 

Suspicious processes provide an example of an attack type that lends itself to 
atomic detection. In the example seen in Figure 5, you can see that Azure 
Security Center has detected that the mimikatz.exe process is running. Mimikatz 
is a tool that has been used by malicious attackers to steal credentials from a

Threat intelligence feeds 

Azure Security Center uses a number of threat intelligence (TI) feeds, such as 
those from the Microsoft Digital Crime Unit, to help detect potential threats 
against Azure resources. Azure Security Center uses these feeds primarily for 
bot detection.  

Several actions are possible if a virtual machine hosted on Azure appears in one 
of these feeds. For example, observing network traffic can confirm that the 
potentially compromised virtual machine is in contact with a command-and-
control server. If this network communication is successfully verified, it’s possible 
to take over the compromised VM’s DNS, which can provide additional insight 
into the botnet infrastructure and IP addresses used by the command-and-
control servers.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   13 

Similar to atomic detections, TI feeds provide a high ROI for threat detection 
because of the simple logic required to attain high fidelity alerts. And as more TI 
providers are added, more detections are possible.  

Azure Security Center alerts users when their virtual machines are discovered to 
be communicating with command-and-control servers. These connections are 
consistent with bot links from computers infected with malware similar to Alina 
or Conficker. Figure 6 shows an alert generated by Azure Security Center based 
on such a detection. 

Figure 6. Azure Security Center showing communication with a C&C server 

 

Behavioral analysis 

Atomic and threat intelligence-based detections are essentially pattern 
matching. To detect more complex threats, more advanced methods of threat 
detection are required. 

One such method is behavioral analysis. In contrast to pattern matching, 
behavioral analysis moves beyond pattern matching and signatures and focuses 
on the malicious behavior. This focus enables defenders to counter attackers 
who generate an almost infinite number of variants for a particular malware. 
Malware designers can change the hash, switch a bit or byte, change a packet or 
pattern; each of these changes would require a new signature. 

Behavioral analysis drills down to what the malware is doing on the system. 
There’s no need to pattern match each malware variant if the behavior of the 
malware can be identified. In the final analysis, it’s the behavior that is of most 

14  PROTECTING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE: DETECTING AND MITIGATING THREATS USING AZURE SECURITY CENTER  

 

 

interest. Each malicious behavior can represent literally thousands of individual 
signature variants. Behavioral analysis is variant resistant. 

However, there are gray areas in some of the behaviors. Such borderline cases 
could lead to false positives. When the system detects these ambiguous 
behaviors, Azure Security Center looks for other behaviors or detections to 
confirm the initial suspicion. More information about the confirmation process is 
provided in the discussion on detection fusion later in this section. 

An example of behavioral analysis: system processes that run in an abnormal 
context. Azure Security Center can detect these situations and fire an alert. In 
the example seen in, you can see that Azure Security Center has detected that 
SVCHOST was running in an abnormal context. SVCHOST is a container process 
for many other system processes and malware often tries to take advantage of 
this to hide its activity. 

Figure 7. Azure Security Center detects processes running in an abnormal context 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   15 

 

Anomaly detection 

Behavioral analysis discovers known threats by detecting known behaviors. This 
process is immensely useful, and significantly extends detection capabilities 
beyond simple signature-based detections.  

The logical next step is to detect unknown threats, which is where anomaly 
detection comes into play. 

With anomaly detection, the system builds a baseline. The baseline is defined by 
the history of a certain element of the virtual machine. If a statistically significant 
deviation from that baseline is detected, an alert might be generated.  

It’s important to note that while the system might generate an alert, it’s possible 
that no alert will be generated. The reason for this possibility is 
that not all deviations from baseline are detrimental. Similar to 
other detections, when the system detects ambiguous activity, 
supporting evidence and correlation with other detections are 
sought to confirm. 

Anomaly detection 
makes it possible 
to move past what 
is already known, 
and discover 
possible new 
exploits. 

One of the major advantages of anomaly detection is that it 
enables detections to move past what is already known, and 
discover possible new exploits. Anomalies can lead researchers 
to dig deeper, and come up with new analytics that define new 
“known” threats. 

An example of an anomaly-based detection is a brute force attack. A brute force 
attack is characterized by repeated attempts to log onto a virtual machine with 
guessed user names and passwords. Azure Security Center can detect that the 
number of failed log on attempts has reached a statistically significant level and 
generate an alert, as seen in Figure 8.  

16  PROTECTING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE: DETECTING AND MITIGATING THREATS USING AZURE SECURITY CENTER  

 

 

Figure 8. Azure Security Center detects a failed brute force attack 

 

Detection fusion 

As stated several times in this section, instances exist when a specific detection is 
non-specific, which requires supporting evidence to reduce the probability of a 
false positive. A very effective method for reducing ambiguity (and the false 
positive rate) is to correlate individual alerts generated throughout the cyber kill 
chain. 

The correlations provide the context needed to confirm that the findings of each 
of the individual alerts represents an actual security event. We call this 
combination or correlation of multiple alerts along the kill chain a security 
incident.  

Security incidents are explicitly identified in the alerts section of Azure Security 
Center. In addition, incidents help to reduce investigation time by providing 
insight into what steps the attacker took, and what specific resources were 
affected. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   17 

Incidents tie together alerts during attack progression. A simplified 
characterization of the cyber kill chain places incidents into one of three phases: 

  Target and attack 

 

Install and exploit 

  Post breach 

Target and attack 

The target and attack phase represents the reconnaissance and deliver phases 
of the cyber kill chain. 

For example, a brute force attack against a virtual machine fits into this phase; 
alerts related to brute force attacks are placed here.  

When an attacker launches a brute force attack against a virtual machine, Azure 
Security Center will use anomaly detection to determine whether the number of 
logon attempts exceeds what is expected. If so, Azure Security Center surfaces a 
failed brute force attempt alert to the user.  

Install and exploit 

The system analyzes the results of the initial attack during the install and exploit 
phase.  

Some of the things considered during this phase include:  

  Evidence of existing malware signatures (using Microsoft antimalware or 

partner solutions) 

 

In-memory malware (using crash dump analysis) 

  Suspicious process execution (using behavioral analysis) 

  Lateral movement 

 

Internal reconnaissance  

Suppose an attacker were able to gain access to a virtual machine using a brute 
force attack (which would have taken place during the target and attack phase). 
Malware is installed on the machine (during the install and exploit phase) and 
the malware ends up causing a process to crash.  

Azure Security Center will collect a copy of the crash dump and scan it for 
evidence of in-memory malware. If an exploit (such as malicious shellcode) is 

18  PROTECTING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE: DETECTING AND MITIGATING THREATS USING AZURE SECURITY CENTER  

 

 

found, an alert will be generated and assigned to the target and attack phase of 
the kill chain. 

Post breach 

Attackers execute their plans during the post breach phase, which includes all 
the activities attackers carry out using automated or manual processes on 
compromised virtual machines. 

For example, a virtual machine is compromised by a brute force attack during 
the target and attack phase and an alert is generated. The attacker installs 
malware, and another alert is generated during the install and exploit phase. 
Finally, the malware generates large amounts of SMTP traffic. This SMTP traffic is 
correlated with the Office 365 SPAM database to determine whether this traffic 
is legitimate or SPAM. If the assessment is SPAM, an alert is generated by Azure 
Security Center. 

In addition to these alerts, an incident (defined as a collection of alerts) is 
generated by Azure Security Center indicating a very high probability that a 
successful compromise has taken place because of the correlation and 
verification of and by multiple alerts. 

Figure 9 shows a number of security incidents as reported by Azure Security 
Center. 

Figure 9. A list of security incidents in Azure Security Center 

Azure Security Center also provides the ability to drill down on a security 
incident and provide detailed information on the individual alerts that were 
correlated to create the incident, as shown in Figure 9.

Summary 

The cloud introduces a number of new attack vectors that were previously 
unavailable to intruders in the on-premises world. These new attack types 
require that we evolve our methods of attack detection. Detecting cloud-based 
attacks requires us to address and act on the differences between the on-
premises and cloud kill chains. There are also security benefits from running 
your workloads in the cloud, as you’ll benefit from Microsoft’s comprehensive 
threat intelligence and security expertise. Azure Security Center takes advantage 
of a multi-layered approach to threat detection, which ranges from rudimentary 
signature based systems all the way up to machine learning driven approaches 
and detection fusion. See azure.microsoft.com for more details and to take 
advantage of a 90 day free trial of Azure Security Center.

PROMETHIUM and 
NEODYMIUM: Parallel zero-
day attacks targeting 
individuals in Europe 

Windows Defender ATP 

Microsoft proactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part 
of this job involves observing the activities of targeted activity groups, which are 
often the first ones to introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used 
by other attackers. The previous two volumes of the Microsoft Security 
Intelligence Report explored the activities of two such groups, code-named 
STRONTIUM and PLATINUM, which used previously unknown vulnerabilities and 
aggressive, persistent techniques to target specific individuals and institutions—
often including military installations, intelligence agencies, and other 
government bodies.  

This volume chronicles two activity groups, code-named PROMETHIUM and 
NEODYMIUM, both of which target individuals in a specific area of Europe. 
Although most malware today either seeks monetary gain or conducts 
espionage for economic advantage, both of these activity groups appear to 
seek information about specific individuals. 

In May 2016, both PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM were observed to launch 
attack campaigns. These campaigns used completely distinct infrastructure and 
primary malware, which indicated a lack of association at the operational level. 
However, the similarity in the campaigns’ victim locale, timing, and use of the 
same zero-day exploit prior to public disclosure strongly indicates that the 
activity groups may be related at a higher organizational tier. 

Microsoft is sharing information about these groups to raise awareness of their 
activities, and to help individuals and organizations implement existing 
mitigation options that significantly reduce risk from these attack groups and 
other similar groups.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   21 

Activity Group Profile: PROMETHIUM 

Campaign summary: PROMETHIUM is an activity group that has been active 
since at least 2012. In 2016, an attack campaign by this group was recorded in 
early May that made use of an exploit for CVE-2016-4117, a vulnerability in 
Adobe Flash Player, which at the time was both unknown and unpatched. 
Adobe promptly and publicly acknowledged the zero-day vulnerability and 
pushed a security update.  

PROMETHIUM and 
NEODYMIUM both 
target individuals 
in a specific area of 
Europe. 

The attack itself began with certain individuals receiving links in 
instant messenger clients. These links led to malicious 
documents that invoked exploit code and eventually executed a 
piece of malware called Truvasys on unsuspecting victims’ 
computers. 

Administrators and users wondering whether they were 
targeted by PROMETHIUM can scan their network by using the 
indicators listed in the appendix, by using Windows Defender to 

examine their logs for “Truvasys,” or by searching for PROMETHIUM in their 
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection product console alerts. 

Attack details: Truvasys has been previously documented by peer organizations 
in the security industry. The malware and its developers have been active for a 
few years and have conducted multiple attack campaigns by masquerading as 
common computer utilities such as WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, and SanDisk. 
In each of the campaigns, the Truvasys malware was updated to include 
additional features, showing close collaboration between the activity groups 
behind the campaigns and the developers of the malware. 

Truvasys is a collection of modules written in the Delphi programming language, 
a variant of Pascal. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit editions of multiple versions of 
Windows, including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, in 
both standard user and administrator modes. It includes a number of features 
designed to evade detection, including virtual environment detection and 
tampering with security software. 

Truvasys connects to a remote command and control (C&C) server to retrieve 
instructions from an attacker, who can use the malware to execute arbitrary 
functionality on the compromised computer. 

22  PROMETHIUM AND NEODYMIUM: PARALLEL ZERO-DAY ATTACKS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE  

 

 

This malware family has targeted individuals through the combined use of spear 
phishing and watering hole techniques for a number of years. In most cases, 
Truvasys is embedded with legitimate installers of applications, compromising 
individual computers by tricking users into running the installers. One campaign 
involved a fake Adobe Flash Player installer, with a social engineering lure in 
Turkish. 

Figure 11. In one campaign, Truvasys was distributed via social engineering lures in the Turkish language 

 

The language used in this example is consistent with the geography of Truvasys 
victims, as observed over the years. Most Truvasys activities have been observed 
across western Europe with a large majority of computers using the Turkish 
locale setting, which suggests that most of them are Turkish citizens or 
expatriates. 

While studying Truvasys, Microsoft uncovered a previously undocumented 
piece of malware known as Myntor that is a completely separate malware family. 
Myntor is pushed onto victims’ computers that are selected by an unknown logic 
devised by PROMETHIUM. 

Activity Group Profile: NEODYMIUM 

Campaign summary: NEODYMIUM is an activity group that, like PROMETHIUM, 
conducted an attack campaign in early May 2016. NEODYMIUM also used the 
exact same CVE-2016-4117 exploit code that PROMETHIUM used, prior to public 
knowledge of the vulnerability’s existence.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   23 

NEODYMIUM used a backdoor detected by Windows Defender as Wingbird, 
whose characteristics closely match FinFisher, a government-grade commercial 
surveillance package. Data about Wingbird activity indicates that it is typically 
used to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks. 

Administrators and users wondering whether they were targeted by 
NEODYMIUM can scan their networks by using the indicators listed in the 
appendix, by using Windows Defender to examine their logs for “Wingbird,” or 
by searching for NEODYMIUM in their Windows Defender Advanced Threat 
Protection product console alerts. 

Attack details: Target individuals were sent customized spear phishing emails. 
An image of one such customized email from this campaign is shown in the 
following figure. 

Figure 12. The spear phishing campaign that NEODYMIUM launched in May 2016 is highly customized to target individuals; a large 
portion of the email has been redacted to protect the privacy of the targeted individual, which shows the extent of personalization of 
the malicious email 

 

When the user opened the attachment, a blank document displayed. In the 
background, a series of events, including the use of the CVE-2016-4117 zero-day 
exploit, ultimately led to the download and execution of a backdoor. The exploit 
code executes only if the Microsoft Office Protected View setting is turned off. 
By default, documents opened from the Internet (using web browsers or email 
clients) are opened in protected view mode, which prevents execution of 
embedded objects and potentially malicious code.

Figure 13. The NEODYMIUM attack chain shows how the exploit CVE-2016-4117 was used to infect target individuals’ computers 

 

The backdoor payload showed behavior that matched publicly documented 
traits of a program called FinFisher, a government-grade commercial 
surveillance package marketed to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 
The publisher, FinFisher GmbH, claims that it sells the software exclusively to 
government agencies for use in targeted and lawful criminal investigations. It is 
likely that the backdoor payload is a relatively new version of the commercial 
spyware.   

The apparent use of a version of FinFisher suggests that the exploit and the 
spear fishing campaign that delivered it were the work of an attack group 
probably connected in some way to a state actor.  

Windows Defender detects the backdoor payload as Wingbird. Visibility into the 
usage of Wingbird shows it has been used only against individuals, not against 
computers that are part of an organization’s network.  

Research into Wingbird from May through November 2016 showed only tens of 
victims, predominantly in Turkey. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   25 

Figure 14. NEODYMIUM victim breakdown, by country for May through November 2016 

 

Like Truvasys, Wingbird is designed to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 
platforms. The malware is a native 32-bit PE executable that installs a number of 
additional executables and files. These components are all embedded within the 
dropper itself, which allows the malware to avoid downloading components and 
consequently attracting attention. 

After the backdoor executes, the malware checks the underlying operating 
system version and, depending on what platform it is running on, drops several 
files to %ProgramData%\RpcSrv (on 32-bit computers) or 
%ProgramData%\AuditService (on 64-bit computers).  

In addition, on 64-bit computers the dropper creates a secondary native 64-bit 
payload executable, referred to in the following diagram as [Payload64].exe. The 
32-bit processes are isolated from 64-bit processes and restricted in the actions 
they can perform. By providing a separate 64-bit payload, Wingbird attempts to 
inject code into 64-bit processes as well as 32-bit processes.

Turkey84%US6%Germany5%UK5% 

Figure 15. Wingbird behaves differently on 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers 

 

The main goal of the original dropper is to indirectly deliver executables by 
injecting malicious code and data into two Windows system processes, 
Services.exe and Winlogon.exe. The primary Wingbird payload uses anti-VM, 
anti-debugging, and anti-AV mechanisms to evade discovery and analysis. 

On 32-bit computers, the original dropper creates three files, as shown in Figure 
5. Of the three files, the only true binary is rpcsrv.dat, a kernel rootkit that 
enables the attacker to load and run privileged unsigned code. The other two 
files, installer.cab and the randomly named [xxxxx].cab, are encrypted data files. 

Wingbird attempts to detect and evade security products. For example, some of 
the strings found in running processes, such as avcuf32.dll and <un-wnd-
%.08x>, indicate that the malware checks for the presence of one of several 
versions of Bitdefender security software. 

Through a series of actions and code injections, the original malware installs the 
rootkit driver, rpcsrv.dat, a non-standard kernel driver. The attackers know that 
64-bit computers are much more secure because they prevent loading of 
unsigned drivers, so they do not even attempt this technique on 64-bit systems. 
The malware searches for a file called ico_ty23.ico, which is publicly documented 
as the filename one of the key user mode DLL components of FinFisher. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   27 

On 64-bit computers, the installation of Wingbird is a lot more complicated. The 
64-bit version of the original payload creates a new folder, 
%ProgramData%\AuditService, and copies the Windows system file lsass.exe 
from %SystemFolder% into the new folder. At the same time, the payload drops 
a malicious file known as sspisrv.dll alongside the copy of lsass.exe. This 
sspisrv.dll file shares its name with a code library that implements several APIs 
that lsass.exe is designed to import. 

Figure 16. Wingbird payload’s behavior on 64-bit computers 

 

The original 32-bit dropper continues monitoring until the folder and file are 
created. After the 64-bit payload is done copying files, its parent process (the 
32-bit dropper) deletes it. The parent process then deletes itself as an attempt to 
hide its tracks and prevent analysis by security professionals. 

The 64-bit malware then injects code into services.exe, the Service Control 
Manager, to register a service using a clean lsass.exe that would load the 
malicious sspisrv.dll, which would then inject malicious code into svchost.exe. 
The constant delegation of malicious code control from one process to the next 
is a way to hide execution of unwanted code and make it extremely difficult to 
detect the presence of Wingbird. 

This version of Wingbird has also been observed with the ability to execute 
highly privileged kernel code by injecting code through vulnerable signed

drivers. It maintains a list of legitimate yet vulnerable drivers that can be 
exploited to inject and execute kernel code.  

It appears that Wingbird obfuscates its code at source level, rather than binary 
level, to evade analysis tools and security solutions. 

Similar to the 32-bit version, this version of Wingbird performs a check for a file 
named ico_sf46.ico, which is a known component of FinFisher. 

Mitigation 

Stopping zero-day exploits in Windows 10 

PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM both used a zero-day 
exploit that executed code to download a malicious payload. 
Protected view, a security feature that was introduced in 
Microsoft Office 2010, prevents the malicious Flash code 
from loading when the document is opened. Control Flow 
Guard, a security feature that is turned on by default in 
Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365 64-bit version, can 
help by making it more difficult to exploit memory corruption 
vulnerabilities. The Flash vulnerability CVE-2016-4117 is a type 
confusion vulnerability in the DeleteRangeTimelineOperation 
class. The referenced exploit only reliably works on specific Windows platforms 
because of a ByteArray mitigation in Flash Player, which causes Microsoft to 
believe that the exploit was authored with pre-knowledge of the victim’s 
computer information. The exploit uses the Adobe Flash Player’s Function object 
vftable corruption method to achieve code execution. 

Control Flow 
Guard makes it 
more difficult to 
exploit memory 
corruption 
vulnerabilities. 

Because 64-bit versions of Windows 10 enforce driver signing, malicious code 
that attempts to load a locally made, untrusted driver will be stopped in its 
tracks. 

In addition, the technique of using lsass.exe to load a malicious DLL files can be 
mitigated by an optional feature introduced in Windows 10 called Credential 
Guard. Microsoft highly recommends that network administrators test and 
enable this feature. In Wingbird’s case, the malicious sspisrv.dll will not load 
because it wasn’t signed by a trusted certificate. 

The Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI) service enables the Device Guard feature 
in Windows 10 to help protect kernel mode processes and drivers from 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   29 

vulnerability exploits and zero-day exploits. HVCI uses the processor’s 
functionality to force all software running in kernel mode to safely allocate 
memory, which means that after memory has been allocated, its state must be 
changed from writable to read-only or execute-only. By forcing memory into 
these states, HVCI helps ensure that attacks are unable to inject malicious code 
into kernel mode processes and drivers through techniques such as buffer 
overflows and heap spraying. 

Detecting malicious behavior with Windows Defender Advanced Threat 
Protection 

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a new built-in detection 
service that ships natively with Windows 10 and helps enterprises to detect 
targeted and advanced attacks. When activated, it captures behavioral signals 
from the endpoint and then uses cloud-based security machine learning 
analytics and threat intelligence to flag suspicious attack-related activities.  

The NEODYMIUM attack campaign executed the following five malicious 
behaviors, all of whichare detected by Windows Defender ATP: 

1.  Zero-day exploit code causes a Microsoft Office file to generate and open 

an executable file.  

Figure 17. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for an exploit resulting in a malicious file executing on an endpoint 

2.  Zero-day exploit code allows an executable file to gain higher privileges. 

3.  A suspicious file self-deletes, a behavior associated with malware that erases 

traces of infection as a way to evade forensic analysis.

Figure 18. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for processes that attempt self-deletion 

4.  Malware executes DLL-side loading, a technique in which attackers replace 

legitimate DLL files in non-standard folders with malicious ones so that the 

malicious file is loaded when the application or operating system starts.  

Figure 19. Windows Defender ATP shows an alert for DLL-side loading 

5.  Malware injects code into legitimate processes, which is usually done to load

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection alerts enterprise security teams 
of detections and allows them to investigate and respond to each security 
incident in a timely and effective manner. The service complements and works 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   31 

along with Windows Defender or third-party antivirus security solutions. 
Additional information about the service is available here. 

Summary 

In May 2016, two apparently unrelated activity groups, PROMETHIUM and 
NEODYMIUM, conducted attack campaigns in Europe that used the same zero-
day exploit while the vulnerability was publicly unknown. Although the use of the 
same exploit code could be attributed to a number of coincidences, the timing 
of the campaigns and victim demographics lend credence to the theory that the 
campaigns were associated. 

One threat family, Wingbird, appears to be a version of a commercially available 
tool sold to organizations conducting lawful interception. Wingbird is a fairly 
advanced threat family that must have required the authors several months’ 
worth of man-hours to generate. Even so, Wingbird as-is does not execute in 
Windows 10. 

Each activity group uses a unique set of tools and methods to perform actions 
like lateral movement and data exfiltration. One of the purposes of tracking 
activity groups is to research unique attacker techniques and to develop 
mitigations for the native operating system. Microsoft has built proactive 
security mitigations into its products, which increases the investment barrier for 
attackers who try to victimize users of the latest versions of Windows. 

The Windows security service Windows Defender ATP provides an additional 
post-breach layer of security to enterprises organizations. As this article shows, 
proactive mitigation in Windows 10 and Office on 64-bit systems does not allow 
the exploit vector for these two attack campaigns or the exploitation of kernel 
drivers to succeed. In addition, Windows Defender ATP detects suspicious 
events on endpoints, alerts security operators about undesired activities, and 
provides the required tool to respond.

Ten years of exploits: A long-
term study of exploitation of 
vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
software 

 

Microsoft researchers conducted a study of security vulnerabilities and 
the exploitation of the most severe vulnerabilities in Microsoft software 
over a 10-year period ending in 2015. In the second half of the past 
decade there have been an increasing number of vulnerability disclosures 
across the entire industry. However, despite the increasing number of 
disclosures, the number of remote code execution (RCE) and elevation of 
privilege (EOP) vulnerabilities in Microsoft software has declined 
significantly. The results of the study suggest that while the risk posed by 
vulnerabilities appeared to increase in recent years, the actualized risk of 
exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software has steadily declined. 

It is impossible to completely prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced 
during the development of large-scale software projects. As long as human 
beings write software code, no software is perfect and mistakes that lead to 
imperfections in software will be made. This fact is reflected in the long-term 
industry vulnerability disclosure data illustrated in Figure 22. Thousands of 
vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed across the industry every year. The 4,512 
vulnerabilities disclosed during the second half of 2014 (2H14) is the largest 
number of vulnerabilities disclosed in any half-year period since the Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures system was launched in 1999.

Microsoft researchers performed a study on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in 
Microsoft software that enabled remote code execution (RCE) and/or elevation 
of privilege (EOP) spanning the last 10 years. These vulnerabilities represent the 
vulnerabilities in Microsoft software with the highest severity scores and are 
generally the vulnerabilities that security and risk professionals are most 
concerned with.

exploited before the corresponding security update release or within 30 days afterward, 2006–2015 

 

  Over the past 6 years, Microsoft has observed a sustained decrease in both 
the percentage and number of vulnerabilities for which there is evidence of 
their being exploited within 30 days of a security update being available. 
(Exploitation risk tends to decrease significantly after 30 days, as most 
organizations have typically tested and deployed the update by that point.) 

 

In 2015, only 5% of Microsoft remote code execution (RCE) and elevation of 
privilege (EOP) vulnerabilities had evidence of being exploited within 30 
days of a security update being available. 

  Microsoft believes that multiple factors have contributed to this decline, such 

as additional hardening measures that are present in the latest versions of 
Microsoft products and the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL).

Timing of the exploitation of RCE and EOP vulnerabilities in Microsoft software per year, 2006–2015 

 

  Over the last six years, it has been observed that if Microsoft vulnerabilities 
are exploited at all, they are most likely to be exploited as zero-day exploits 
– that is, exploited before a security update is available. 

  This observation suggests that exploiting vulnerabilities after a security 

update has been released is not generally seen as desirable by attackers. 
One contributing factor  might be the mature security update release and 
deployment model that Microsoft uses to help ensure customers are kept 
up-to-date.  

Each year over the past decade, thousands of vulnerability disclosures have 
been made across the industry. A series of vulnerability disclosure increases 
across the industry since the second half of 2011 culminated in the largest 
number of vulnerabilities disclosed in any half-year period since the CVE system 
was launched in 1999, with 4,512 vulnerabilities disclosed during the second half 
of 2014.  

Despite these increases, the number of RCE and EOP vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
software for which there was evidence of their being exploited decreased by 
almost 60% during the same period, and decreased by more than 70% since 
2010. This evidence suggests that although potential risk due to vulnerabilities

Mitigations such as 
ASLR, DEP, and 
SEHOP make it 
harder to 
successfully exploit

Newer software typically has fewer vulnerabilities than older 
software. Newer software that uses mitigations built into the 
Windows platform, such as Address Space Layout 
Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), 
Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), 
and others, make it harder to successfully exploit 
vulnerabilities that do exist. Microsoft Edge has advanced 
security technologies and significantly less of an attack 
surface than older browsers, making exploitation much more 
difficult and helping make the web a safer experience.3 
Windows 10 has been hardened against attacks from every 
direction and at every layer of the stack; more information is available here.4 The 
Microsoft cloud provides a more holistic security platform, with unique insights 
into the threat landscape, informed by trillions of signals from billions of sources, 
than what most customers have in their on-premises IT environments today. For 
many organizations, these capabilities make the cloud a key part of their risk 
management strategy.

Vulnerabilities 

Vulnerabilities, in the context of computer security, are 
weaknesses in software that could allow an attacker to 
compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the 
software. Some of the worst vulnerabilities allow attackers to 
exploit the compromised system by causing it to run malicious 
code without the user’s knowledge. 

Industry-wide vulnerability disclosures 

A disclosure, as the term is used in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, is 
the revelation of a software vulnerability to the public at large. Disclosures can 
come from a variety of sources, including publishers of the affected software, 
security software vendors, independent security researchers, and even malware 
creators. 

The information in this section is compiled from vulnerability disclosure data that 
is published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the US government’s 
repository of standards-based vulnerability management data at nvd.nist.gov. 
The NVD represents all disclosures that have a published CVE (Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier.5  

Figure 25 illustrates the number of vulnerability disclosures across the software 
industry for each half-year period since 2H13. (See “Appendix A: Threat naming 
conventions” on page 135 for an explanation of the reporting period 
nomenclature used in this report.) 

                                                           
5 CVE entries are subject to ongoing revision as software vendors and security researchers publish more 
information about vulnerabilities. For this reason, the statistics presented here may differ slightly from 
comparable statistics published in previous volumes of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   43 

Figure 25. Industrywide vulnerability disclosures, 2H13–1H16 

 

  Vulnerability disclosures across the industry decreased 9.8 percent between 

2H15 and 1H16, to just above 3,000.  

  Prior to the decrease in 1H16, vulnerability disclosures had trended generally 

upward over the past three years, with the exception of a spike in 2H14 
caused by a research project at the Computer Emergency Response Team 
(CERT) Coordination Center (CERT/CC) that uncovered SSL-related man-in-
the-middle vulnerabilities in a large number of Android apps in the Google 
Play Store.  

Vulnerability severity 

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized, platform-
independent scoring system for rating IT vulnerabilities. The CVSS base metric 
assigns a numeric value between 0 and 10 to vulnerabilities based on factors 
such as potential impact, access vectors, and ease of exploitation, with higher 
scores representing greater severity. (See A Complete Guide to the Common 
Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0 at first.org for more information.)

  Disclosures of high-severity vulnerabilities—those with CVSS scores of 7 and 

above—decreased 16.9 percent across the industry in 1H16, to account for 
38.3 percent of all vulnerabilities, smaller than in 2H15 but larger than in any 
other period over the last several years. 

  Of these, the highest severity vulnerabilities—those rated 9.9 or higher—
accounted for more than a third of all high-severity vulnerabilities, or 10.9 
percent of vulnerabilities overall, as shown in Figure 27.

slightly between 2H15 and 1H16, and accounted for 52.7 percent and 9.0 
percent of all vulnerabilities, respectively. 

Vulnerability complexity 

Some vulnerabilities are easier to exploit than others, and vulnerability 
complexity is an important factor to consider in determining the magnitude of 
the threat that a vulnerability poses. A high-severity vulnerability that can only 
be exploited under very specific and rare circumstances might require less 
immediate attention than a lower-severity vulnerability that can be exploited 
more easily. 

The CVSS assigns each vulnerability a complexity ranking of Low, Medium, or 
High. (See A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
Version 2.0 at first.org for more information about the CVSS complexity ranking 
system.) Figure 28 shows complexity trends for vulnerabilities disclosed since 
2H13. Note that Low complexity in Figure 28 indicates greater risk, just as High 
severity indicates greater risk in Figure 26. 

Figure 28. Industrywide vulnerability disclosures by access complexity, 2H13–1H16 

  Disclosures of low-complexity vulnerabilities—those that are the easiest to 
exploit—accounted for the largest category of disclosures, at 52.7 percent 
of all disclosures for the period. Low-complexity vulnerabilities reversed a

multi-year trend of increases in 1H16, and ended the period with the fewest 
low-complexity vulnerabilities since 1H14. 

  Medium-complexity vulnerabilities accounted for the second largest share, 

at 42.5 percent of all vulnerabilities. After increasing slightly in 2H15, 
medium-complexity vulnerabilities decreased again in 1H16 to nearly the 
same number as a year prior. 

  Disclosures of high-complexity vulnerabilities more than 
doubled from 2H15 to 1H16, but still only accounted for 
4.8 percent of all disclosures. 

Operating system, browser, and application 
vulnerabilities 

Comparing vulnerabilities that affect a computer’s operating 
system to vulnerabilities that affect other components, such 
as applications and utilities, requires a determination of 
whether the affected component is considered part of the 
operating system. This determination is not always simple 
and straightforward, given the componentized nature of 
modern operating systems. Some programs (media players, for example) ship 
by default with some operating system software but can also be downloaded 
from the software vendor’s website and installed individually. Linux distributions, 
in particular, are often assembled from components developed by different 
teams, many of which provide crucial operating functions such as a graphical 
user interface (GUI) or Internet browsing. 

Disclosures of 
high-complexity 
vulnerabilities 
more than 
doubled, but still 
only accounted for 
4.8 percent of all 
vulnerabilities. 

To facilitate analysis of operating system and browser vulnerabilities, the 
Microsoft Security Intelligence Report distinguishes among four different kinds of 
vulnerabilities: 

  Core operating system vulnerabilities are those with at least one operating 

system platform enumeration (/o) in the NVD that do not also have any 
application platform enumerations (/a).6 

  Operating system application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /o 

platform enumeration and at least one /a platform enumeration listed in the 
NVD, except as described in the next bullet point. 

                                                           
6 See nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm for information about the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) standard for 
naming information technology systems, software, and packages. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   47 

  Browser vulnerabilities are those that affect components defined as part of a 
web browser, including Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari (which ship with 
operating systems) along with third-party browsers such as Mozilla Firefox 
and Google Chrome. 

  Other application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /a platform 

enumeration in the NVD that do not have any /o platform enumerations, 
except as described in the previous bullet point. 

Figure 29 shows industrywide vulnerabilities for operating systems, browsers, 
and applications since 2H13. 

Figure 29. Industrywide operating system, browser, and application vulnerabilities, 2H13–1H16 

 

  Disclosures of vulnerabilities in applications other than web browsers and 

operating system applications decreased slightly in 1H16, but remained the 
most common type of vulnerability during the period, accounting for 45.8 
percent of all disclosures for the period.  

  Core operating system vulnerability disclosures were down from 2H15, but 

remained in second place in 1H16, at 22.5 percent of all disclosures. 

  Operating system application vulnerability disclosures accounted for 22.4 

percent of all disclosures in 1H16, just behind core operating system 
vulnerability disclosures.

Guidance: Developing secure software 

The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) (www.microsoft.com/sdl) is a free 
software development methodology that incorporates security and privacy best 
practices throughout all phases of the development process, with the goal of 
protecting software users. Using such a methodology can help reduce the 
number and severity of vulnerabilities in software and help manage 
vulnerabilities that might be discovered after deployment.  

“Life in the Digital Crosshairs,” at sdlstory.com, is a multimedia presentation that 
explores the genesis and development of the SDL from its origins in the 
Windows team’s well-documented all-hands security push in the early 2000s. It 
includes interviews with several of the pivotal figures in the history of the SDL

with an interest in secure development are likely to find the site invaluable for 
putting the SDL into historical context and understanding what the future holds.

50  VULNERABILITIES  

 

 

Exploits 

An exploit is a piece of code that uses software vulnerabilities 
to access information on a computer or install malware. 
Exploits target vulnerabilities in operating systems, web 
browsers, applications, or other software components that are 
installed on a computer.  

In some scenarios, targeted components are add-ons that may be pre-installed 
by the computer manufacturer before the computer is sold. A user may not 
even use the vulnerable add-on or be aware that it is installed. In addition, some 
software has no facility for updating itself, so even if the software vendor 
publishes an update that fixes the vulnerability, the user may not know that the 
update is available or how to obtain it and therefore remains vulnerable to 
attack. 

Software vulnerabilities are enumerated and documented in 
the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list 
(cve.mitre.org), a standardized repository of vulnerability 
information. Here and throughout this report, exploits are 
labeled with the CVE identifier that pertains to the affected 
vulnerability, if applicable. In addition, exploits that affect 
vulnerabilities in Microsoft software are labeled with the 
Microsoft Security Bulletin number that pertains to the 
vulnerability, if applicable.7 

Some exploits 
target add-ons 
that may be 
preinstalled by the 
computer 
manufacturer. 

Microsoft real-time security products can detect and block attempts to exploit 
known vulnerabilities whether the computer is affected by the vulnerabilities or 
not. For example, the CVE-2010-2568 CplLnk vulnerability has never affected 
Windows 8, but if a Windows 8 user receives a malicious file that attempts to 
exploit that vulnerability, Windows Defender is designed to detect and block it 
anyway. Encounter data provides important information about which products 
and vulnerabilities are being targeted by attackers, and by what means. 
However, the statistics presented in this report should not be interpreted as

evidence of successful exploit attempts, or of the relative vulnerability of 
computers to different exploits. 

Figure 31 shows the prevalence of different types of exploits detected by 
Microsoft antimalware products each quarter from 3Q15 to 2Q16, by encounter 
rate. Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time 
security products that report a malware encounter. For example, the encounter 
rate for operating system exploit attempts in 2Q16 was 0.14 percent, meaning 
that 0.14 percent of computers running Microsoft real-time security software in 
2Q16 encountered operating system exploit attempts, and 99.86 percent did 
not. In other words, a computer selected at random would have had about a 
0.14 percent chance of encountering an operating system exploit attempt in 
2Q16. Only computers whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft 
are considered when calculating encounter rates.8 See page 71 for more 
information about the encounter rate metric. 

Figure 31. Encounter rates for different types of exploit attempts, 3Q15–2Q16 

 
Computers that report more than one type of exploit are counted for each type detected. * Figures for exploit kits, Java, and Adobe 
Flash Player exploits are affected by IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer, which blocks many threats before they are 
encountered. See page 65 for more information.

  After increasing significantly between 3Q15 and 4Q15, encounters with 

exploit kits decreased by more than a third from 4Q15 to 1Q16. They 
remained the most commonly encountered type of exploit in the second 
half of the year, with an encounter rate more than four times that of the next 
most common type of exploit. See “Exploit kits” on page 54 for more 
information about these exploits. 

  Exploit attempts involving Adobe Flash Player increased significantly in 1Q16 

with the appearance of SWF/Netis, then returned to much lower levels in 
2Q16 as Netis encounters decreased. 

  The number of encounters with exploits that target operating systems 

decreased slightly during both quarters in 1H16, but ended the period in 
second place as Adobe Flash Player exploits receded. See “Operating 
system exploits” on page 59 for more information. 

  Encounters with Java exploits, HTML/JavaScript exploits, and other types of 
exploits each accounted for less than 0.1 percent of all malware encounters 
in 1H16. See the remainder of this section for more information about these 
exploits.

  Exploit kits accounted for four of the 10 most commonly encountered exploit 

detections during 1H16. See “Exploit kits” on page 54 for more information 
about exploit kits. 

  SWF/Netis uses a critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) 

to download and run files on the infected computer. Adobe released 
Security Bulletin APSB15-16 in July 2015 to address the issue. 

Exploit kits 
accounted for four 
of the 10 most 
commonly 
encountered 
exploit detections 
during 1H16. 

CVE-2010-2568 is a vulnerability in Windows Shell. 

 
Detections are often identified as variants in the Win32/CplLnk 
family, although several other malicious software families 
attempt to exploit the vulnerability as well. An attacker exploits 
CVE-2010-2568 by creating a malformed shortcut file—typically 
distributed through social engineering or other methods—that 
forces a vulnerable computer to load a malicious file when the 
shortcut icon is displayed in File Explorer. The vulnerability was 
first discovered being used by the malware family 
Win32/Stuxnet in mid-2010, and it has since been exploited by a 
number of other families, many of which predated the 

disclosure of the vulnerability and were subsequently adapted to attempt to 
exploit it. Microsoft published Security Bulletin MS10-046 in August 2010 to 
address the issue. Windows 8 and subsequently released versions of 
Windows have never been vulnerable to exploits of CVE-2010-2568. 

  HTML/IframeRef is a generic detection for specially formed HTML inline 

frame (IFrame) tags that redirect to remote websites that contain malicious 
content. More properly considered exploit downloaders than true exploits, 
these malicious pages use a variety of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in 
browsers and plug-ins. The only commonality is that the attacker uses an 
inline frame to deliver the exploits to users. The exact exploit delivered and 
detected by one of these inline frames might be changed frequently. 

  SWF/Dlcypt is an Adobe Flash Player file that may be used by attackers to 

decrypt and execute encrypted JavaScript files. It is configured to a run with 
a frame size of zero by zero pixels, which allows it to run without being 
noticed. 

Exploit kits 

Exploit kits are collections of exploits bundled together and sold as commercial 
software or as a service. Prospective attackers buy or rent exploit kits on 
malicious hacker forums and through other illegitimate outlets. A typical kit 

54  EXPLOITS  

 

 

comprises a collection of webpages that contain exploits for several 
vulnerabilities in popular web browsers and browser add-ons. When the 
attacker installs the kit on a malicious or compromised web server, visitors who 
don’t have the appropriate security updates installed are at risk of having their 
computers compromised through drive-by download attacks. (See page 119 for 
more information about drive-by downloads.) 

Figure 33. How a typical exploit kit works 

Microsoft security products detect and block the characteristic techniques that a 
number of common exploit kits use to infect computers, along with several 
generic HTML and JavaScript exploit techniques. Figure 34 shows the 
prevalence of several top web-based exploit kits and techniques during each of 
the four most recent quarters.

 

JS/Axpergle, a detection for the so-called Angler exploit kit, was the most 
commonly encountered exploit kit family in 1H16. It is known to target a 
number of vulnerabilities in Silverlight (CVE-2013-0074), Internet Explorer 
(CVE-2013-2551), Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-0310, CVE-2015-0311, and 
CVE-2015-0313, among others), and Java (CVE-2013-2460), although exploit 
kit authors frequently change the exploits included in their kits in an effort to 
stay ahead of software publishers and security software vendors. Encounters 
involving Axpergle fell sharply at the end of 2Q16, a development that some 
news reports have linked to the breakup of a cybercrime ring by Russian 
federal authorities in June.9 If Angler remains dormant, encounters involving 
its two most active competitors, RIG and Neutrino, may be expected to rise 
significantly in the second half of the year. 

  Encounters involving the RIG exploit kit (detected as HTML/Meadgive) 

declined somewhat from 2H15, but remained the second most commonly 
encountered kit during both quarters in 1H16. It targets vulnerabilities in 
Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-8651 and CVE-2015-0311), Java (CVE-2013-
2423, CVE-2013-1493, and CVE-2012-1723), and Silverlight (CVE-2013-3896 
and CVE-2013-0074), among other components.

  The Neutrino exploit kit (detected as JS/NeutrinoEK) added a number of 
new Adobe Flash Player exploits in 1H16, including CVE-2016-4117, CVE-
2016-1019, and CVE-2015-8651.  

Java exploits 

Figure 35 shows the prevalence of different Java exploits by quarter. 

Figure 35. Trends for the top Java exploits detected and blocked by Microsoft real-time antimalware products in 1H16 

 
Encounter figures are affected by IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer, which blocks many threats before they are encountered. 
See page 65 for more information. 

  Overall, encounters with Java exploits continued to decrease significantly in 
1H16. This decrease is likely caused by several important changes in the way 
web browsers evaluate and execute Java applets: 

  The IExtensionValidation interface in Internet Explorer 11, released in late 

2013, provides a mechanism for security software to validate that a 

webpage is safe before allowing instantiation of ActiveX controls, such 

as the control that hosts embedded Java applets. If a webpage is 

determined to be malicious, the ActiveX controls are blocked from 

loading, and the actual Java exploit itself is therefore never encountered. 

(See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation” 

on page 65 for more information.) Subsequent Internet Explorer security 

updates released in 2014 added an isolated heap mechanism and a

 

In September 2014, Microsoft published updates for 

versions 8 through 11 of Internet Explorer to begin blocking out-

of-date ActiveX controls, including controls that host older 

versions of the JRE in the browser. As explained in this section, 

the most commonly encountered Java exploits all target 

vulnerabilities that were addressed with security updates years 

ago, but remain present in out-of-date Java installations. When 

a webpage attempts to load one of the vulnerable versions of Java in 

Internet Explorer with the update applied, the control is blocked by 

default and the user is urged to update Java to a more secure version.

 

In January 2016, Oracle announced that it would be deprecating the 

Java browser plugin in JDK 9, scheduled for release in 2017. 

  Microsoft Edge, the newest Microsoft web browser and the default 

browser in Windows 10, does not support Java or other ActiveX plugins, 

which eliminates the possibility of Java exploits being delivered within 

the browser. See “A break from the past, part 2: Saying goodbye to 

ActiveX, VBScript, attachEvent…” (May 6, 2015) at the Microsoft Edge 

Dev Blog at blogs.windows.com/msedgedev for more information. 

  CVE-2012-1723, the most commonly encountered individual Java exploit in 

1H16, is a type-confusion vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
that is exploited by tricking the JRE into treating one type of variable like 
another type. Oracle confirmed the existence of the vulnerability in June 
2012, and addressed it the same month with its June 2012 Critical Patch 
Update. The vulnerability was observed being exploited in the wild 
beginning in early July 2012, and has been used in a number of exploit kits.

For more information about this exploit, see the entry “The rise of a new 
Java vulnerability - CVE-2012-1723” (August 1, 2012) in the Microsoft 
Malware Protection Center (MMPC) blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc. 

  CVE-2010-0840 is a JRE vulnerability that was first disclosed in March 2010 

and addressed by Oracle with a security update the same month. The 
vulnerability was previously exploited by some versions of the Blackhole 
exploit kit (detected as JS/Blacole), which has been inactive in recent years. 

  CVE-2012-0507 allows an unsigned Java applet to gain 
elevated permissions and potentially have unrestricted 
access to a host system outside its sandbox environment. 
The vulnerability is a logic error that allows attackers to 
run code with the privileges of the current user, which 
means that an attacker can use it to perform reliable 
exploitation on other platforms that support the JRE, 
including Apple Mac OS X, Linux, VMWare, and others. 
Oracle released a security update in February 2012 to 
address the issue.

been modified by malware obfuscation, often in an attempt to avoid 
detection by security software. Files identified as Java/Obfuscator can 
represent exploits that target many different Java vulnerabilities. 

  CVE-2013-0422 first appeared in January 2013 as a zero-day vulnerability. 

CVE-2013-0422 is a package access check vulnerability that allows an 
untrusted Java applet to access code in a trusted class, which then loads the 
attacker’s own class with elevated privileges. Oracle published a security 
update to address the vulnerability on January 13, 2013. 

For more information about CVE-2013-0422, see the entry “A technical 
analysis of a new Java vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422)” (January 20, 2013) in 
the MMPC blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc. 

Operating system exploits 

Although most operating system exploits detected by Microsoft security 
products are designed to affect the platforms on which the security products 
run, malicious or infected files that affect other operating systems are sometimes 
downloaded. Figure 37 shows trends for the individual exploits most commonly 
detected and blocked or removed during each of the past four quarters.

  Win32/CplLnk, an exploit that targets a vulnerability in Windows Shell, 

remained the most commonly encountered operating system exploit in 
1H16. An attacker exploits the vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) by creating a 
malformed shortcut file that forces a vulnerable computer to load a 
malicious file when the shortcut icon is displayed in File Explorer. Microsoft 
released Security Bulletin MS10-046 in August 2010 to address this issue. 

  Two of the five most commonly encountered operating system exploits on 
Windows computers in 1H16 actually target the Android mobile operating 
system published by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. Microsoft 
security products detect these threats when Android devices or storage 
cards are connected to computers running Windows, or when Android 
users knowingly or unknowingly download infected or malicious programs

detections that affect Android involve exploits that enable an attacker or 
other user to obtain root privileges on vulnerable Android devices. Device 
owners sometimes use such exploits intentionally to gain access to 
additional functionality (a practice often called rooting or jailbreaking), but 
these exploits can also be used by attackers to infect devices with malware 
that bypasses many typical security systems. 

  Unix/Lotoor is an exploit family that exploits 

vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to 

gain root privileges on a mobile device. Google 

published a source code update in March 2011 to 

address the vulnerability.

vulnerability because of its use by a popular rooting 

application of that name. It is also used by

GingerMaster might be bundled with clean applications, and includes an 

exploit for the CVE-2011-1823 vulnerability disguised as an image file. 

Google published a source code update in May 2011 to address the 

vulnerability. 

  CVE-2014-6332 is a vulnerability in Windows Object Linking and Embedding 

(OLE) that can be used to launch remote attacks on a computer through 
Internet Explorer in some circumstances. Microsoft released Security Bulletin 
MS14-064 in November 2014 to address this issue. See “The life and times of 
an exploit” on pages 3–10 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 
18 (July–December 2014), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for 
more information about this vulnerability and what Microsoft has done to 
mitigate it.  

Document exploits 

Document exploits are exploits that target vulnerabilities in the way a document 
editing or viewing application processes a particular file format. Figure 38 shows 
encounter rates for individual exploits.

  Most detections of exploits that affect Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 
were associated with the exploit family Win32/Pdfjsc, a detection for PDF 
files containing a malicious JavaScript that targets CVE-2010-0188 and other 
vulnerabilities. Adobe released Security Bulletin APSB10-07 in February 2010 
to address CVE-2010-0188. Pdfjsc and related exploits were particularly 
prevalent in eastern Europe. Pdfjsc mostly targets older Java vulnerabilities, 
so attackers may find it less useful as more computers are updated to newer 
versions of Java, which could explain the decrease in encounters over the 
past several quarters. 

  CVE-2012-0158 is a remote code execution in Windows Common Controls 

that affects certain older versions of Microsoft Office. Microsoft released 
Security Bulletin MS12-027 in April 2012 to address the issue. 

  CVE-2010-3336 is a memory corruption vulnerability in several older 
versions of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Word that allows a remote 
attacker to execute arbitrary code via a malicious document. Microsoft 
released Security Bulletin MS10-087 in November 2010 to address the issue.

  SWF/Netis uses a critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) 

to download and run files on the infected computer. Adobe released 
Security Bulletin APSB15-16 in July 2015 to address the issue. Netis appeared 
in 1Q16 at a worldwide encounter rate of 0.27 percent, making it the second 
most commonly encountered exploit during the quarter, before encounters 
dropped to much lower levels in 2Q16. 

  Win32/ShellCode is a detection for a Flash Player file that attempts to exploit 

several vulnerabilities in versions of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. In 
the wild, the malicious .swf file has been observed to be embedded in a PDF 
attachment in spam email messages, alongside other malware components.  

  Although Adobe Flash Player continues to be a primary target for exploit kits 

and targeted attackers, evidence suggests that attackers had a harder time 
exploiting it in 1H16 than in previous periods: fewer zero-day Flash Player 
exploits were discovered in 1H16 than during comparable periods in 2015, 
and fewer post-update exploits were incorporated into exploit kits. Part of 
this change is likely due to aggressive efforts on the part of Adobe to add 
new exploit mitigations to Flash Player in recent years, including adopting 
the Control Flow Guard technology in Windows 10, which makes memory

to take a “low hanging fruit” approach of concentrating their efforts on the 
vectors that they believe are easiest to exploit. If attackers continue to find 
Flash Player harder to exploit, they may begin to shift their attention to other 
potential vectors, in much the same way that they largely stopped 
attempting to exploit the Java Runtime Environment in favor of Flash Player 
a few years ago.

Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and IExtensionValidation 

IExtensionValidation is an interface introduced in Internet Explorer 11 that real-
time security software can implement to block ActiveX controls from loading on 
malicious pages. (Microsoft Edge, the newest Microsoft web browser and the 
default browser in Windows 10, does not support ActiveX plug-ins at all, and 
therefore does not use IExtensionValidation.) When Internet Explorer loads a 
webpage that includes ActiveX controls, if the security software has 
implemented IExtensionValidation, the browser calls the security software to 
scan the HTML and script content on the page before loading the controls 
themselves. If the security software determines that the page is malicious (for 
example, if it identifies the page as an exploit kit landing page), it can direct 
Internet Explorer to prevent individual controls or the entire page from loading. 

Figure 41. Internet Explorer 11 can block pages that contain ActiveX controls if security software determines that the page is malicious 

Figure 42 shows the types of ActiveX controls identified on malicious webpages 
in Internet Explorer 11 for each quarter from 3Q15 to 2Q16.

  Adobe Flash Player objects were the most commonly detected type of 

object hosted on malicious pages in each of the past four quarters, reaching 
a high of 99.2 percent in 4Q15 before declining to 69.3 percent in 2Q16. 

  Pages hosting malicious Silverlight objects increased in 1H16 as several 

exploit kits added exploits for two recently disclosed Silverlight 
vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-1671 and CVE-2016-0034. Microsoft published 
Security Bulletins MS15-044 in May 2015 and MS16-006 in January 2016, 
respectively, to address the vulnerabilities. 

Exploits used in targeted attacks 

A targeted attack is an attack against the computers or networks of a specific 
group of companies or individuals. This type of attack usually attempts to gain 
access to the computer or network before trying to steal information or disrupt 
the infected computers. Figure 43 lists some of the exploits Microsoft has 
observed being used in targeted attacks in 1H16.

Adobe Flash Player 

Although the majority of remote code execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerabilities 
used in 1H16 targeted attacks affected Adobe Flash, there were fewer Flash 
Player exploits compared to previous periods, and exploit kit authors have not 
been integrating Flash exploits as quickly as in 2015. 

  CVE-2016-1010 - Flash Player “copyPixels” integer overflow: This vulnerability 

was exploited in limited attacks targeting multiple browsers from different 
vendors and distributed in a particular region of the world, most likely used 
in a campaign since December, 2015. The attacker was able to inject on-the-
fly the Flash Player exploit on certain websites through some form of MITM 
and JavaScript redirection. Adobe released Security Bulletin APSB16-08 out-
of-band to neutralize the attack as soon as possible, and the exploit was not 
subsequently observed being used by exploit kits.

  CVE-2016-1019 - Flash Player “ASNative” type confusion: This zero-day 

exploit, first reported by researchers at FireEye11 and Proofpoint,12 is unusual 
in that it was first observed being used by an exploit kit in April 2016, rather 
than by a targeted attack group. A few exploit kits have used this 
vulnerability to target Internet Explorer, while Microsoft Edge was not 
targeted because of its additional capabilities for mitigating common 
exploitation techniques used by this exploit. 

  CVE-2016-4117 – Flash Player “DeleteRangeTimelineOperation” type 

CVE-2016-1010 was 
exploited in limited 
attacks targeting 
multiple browsers 
from different 
vendors. 

confusion: This Flash Player vulnerability was exploited through 
a malicious RTF document sent as an email attachment that 
embedded a Flash payload with the exploit as reported by 
FireEye.13 The attack was limited and targeted a few selected 
individuals and telco companies in the Middle East. (See 
“PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM: Parallel zero-day attacks 
targeting individuals in Europe” on page 21 for more 
information about this attack.) This exploit was later integrated 
into exploit kits and used also by other activity groups (for 
example, STRONTIUM) in different campaigns after the 

disclosure and release of the patch. 

  CVE-2016-4171 – Flash Player malformed ExecPolicy tag: This zero-day 

exploit was found by Kaspersky researchers14 and used in limited targeted 
attacks by an activity group that Kaspersky has dubbed “ScarCruft”.15 
Microsoft telemetry suggests evidence of this vulnerability being exploited 
through targeted spear-phishing emails sent to selected targets, including 
victims in Korea and China. This exploit was not observed being used by 
exploit kits after Adobe released the corresponding security update.

Microsoft products 

The two exploits affecting Microsoft Windows are both elevation of privilege 
(EoP) exploits used as second-stage payloads immediately after an initial remote 
code execution (RCE) exploit to gain higher privileges or escape a sandbox. 
Windows, Silverlight, and Internet Explorer were the only Microsoft products 
affected by zero-day RCE vulnerabilities. Microsoft Edge was not affected by any 
known zero-day exploits used in targeted attacks in 1H16. 

  CVE-2016-0034 - Silverlight “GetChars()” memory 
corruption: This exploit targeted a Remote Code 
Execution vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Silverlight 
browser plugin. Discovered by Kaspersky researchers in 
January 2016,16 the exploit was probably created in 
approximately July 2015 and used in a campaign that 
targeted computers in southeast Asia. Evidence found by 
security researchers suggests a link between this exploit 
and the 2015 breach of the Hacking Team security 
company, which resulted in details of multiple exploits 
being disclosed to the public. After Microsoft released Security Bulletin 
MS16-006 in January 2016 to address the issue, it was integrated into a 
number of exploit kits.

point-of-sale (PoS) and payment card data.17 Attackers used social 
engineering to induce users to execute Microsoft Word binary documents 
that contained malicious macros. Microsoft released Security Bulletin MS16-

  CVE-2016-0189 - VBScript engine memory corruption: This exploit was 

initially used in a limited targeted attack in Asia, particularly South Korea.18 
The exploit was hosted on a compromised legitimate website and crafted 
specifically to target Internet Explorer users running Windows 7; the exploit 
is ineffective against the latest versions of Windows because of mitigations 
such as Control Flow Guard (CFG), introduced in Windows 8.1. After 
Microsoft released Security Bulletin MS16-051 in May 2016 to address the 
issue, other researchers published a proof-of-concept fully working exploit 
for this vulnerability, and the exploit code was soon integrated into multiple 
exploit kits.

Malicious and unwanted 
software 

Most attempts by malware to infect computers are 
unsuccessful. More than three-quarters of Internet-connected 
personal computers worldwide are protected by real-time 
security software that constantly monitors the computers and 
network traffic for threats and blocks them before they can 
infect the computers, if possible. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of the malware landscape requires 
consideration of infection attempts that are blocked as well as 
infections that are removed.  

Microsoft uses two different metrics to measure malicious and unwanted 
software prevalence:19 

  Encounter rate is simply the percentage of computers running Microsoft 

real-time security products that report a malware encounter.20 For example, 
the encounter rate for the malware family JS/Axpergle in Canada in 2Q16 
was 2.7 percent. This data means that, of the computers in Canada that 
were running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q16, 2.7 percent 
reported encountering the Axpergle family, and 97.3 percent did not. 
Encountering a threat does not mean the computer has been infected. Only 
computers whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft are 
considered when calculating encounter rates.21 

                                                           
19 Microsoft regularly reviews and refines its data collection methodology to improve its scope and accuracy. 
For this reason, the statistics presented in this volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report may differ 
slightly from comparable statistics in previous volumes.  
20 Encounter rate does not include threats that are blocked by a web browser before being detected by 
antimalware software. In particular, IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer 11 enables security software to 
block pages that contain exploits from loading. (See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and 
IExtensionValidation” on page 65 for information about IExtensionValidation and the threats it blocks.) For this 
reason, encounter rate figures may not fully reflect all of the threats encountered by computer users. 
21 For information about the products and services that provide data for this report, see “Appendix B: Data 
sources” on page 137. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   71 

  Computers cleaned per mille, or CCM, is an infection rate metric that is 

defined as the number of computers cleaned for every 1,000 unique 
computers that run the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free tool 
distributed through Microsoft update services that removes more than 200 
highly prevalent or serious threats from computers. Because it is not a real-
time tool, the MSRT only detects and removes threats that are already 
present on the computer; it does not block infection attempts as they 
happen. 

Figure 44 illustrates the difference between these two metrics. 

Figure 44. Worldwide encounter and infection rates, 3Q15–2Q16, by quarter 

 

As Figure 44 shows, and as one would expect, encounters are much more 
common than infections. On average, about 20.6 percent of reporting 
computers worldwide encountered threats over the past four quarters. At the 
same time, the MSRT removed threats from about 10.1 out of every 1,000 
computers, or 1.01 percent. Together, encounter and infection rate information 
can help provide a broader picture of the threat landscape by offering different 
perspectives on how threats propagate and how computers get infected.

Learning about new threats with cloud-based protection in 
Windows Defender 

Several of the threats discussed in this volume of the Security Intelligence Report, 
such as Win32/Spursint and Win32/Rundas, are identified as cloud-based 
detections. These are not true malware families as the term is usually used. 
Instead, they are detections for malicious files that have been automatically 
identified through the cloud-based protection feature of Windows Defender in 
Windows 10.  

When cloud-based protection is enabled, Windows Defender queries the cloud 
protection backend when encountering a suspicious but undetected file. The 
backend service uses heuristics, machine learning, and automated file analysis to 
determine whether the file is malicious. If the cloud protection service 
determines that the file is malicious, Windows Defender blocks it, and the service 
uses the information to provide enhanced protection to other users. In many 
cases, this process can reduce the response time when a new threat emerges 
from hours to seconds. Some of these automatically identified threats have 
proven to be highly prevalent—Spursint, for example, was the second most 
commonly encountered malicious software detection in 2Q16, and the fourth 
most commonly encountered malicious software detection in 1H16 overall. The 
prevalence of these threats serves as a vivid example of the potential for 
increased protection offered by cloud-based antimalware technologies. 

Cloud-based protection is enabled by default in the Anniversary Update edition 
of Windows 10. For more information about the feature and guidance for 
administering it in network environments, see the article “Block at First Sight” at 
technet.microsoft.com. 

Malicious and unwanted software worldwide 

The telemetry data generated by Microsoft security products from computers 
whose administrators or users choose to opt in to provide data to Microsoft 
includes information about the location of the computer, as determined by IP 
geolocation. This data makes it possible to compare infection and encounter 
rates, patterns, and trends in different locations around the world.22

with Malware” (November 15, 2011) in the Microsoft Cyber Trust Blog (blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust).

  Locations in Figure 45 are ordered by the number of computers reporting 

detections in 1H16. 

  The encounter rate in the United States was about 40 percent lower (or 

approximately 8–9 percentage points lower) than the worldwide encounter 
rate in 1H16. The exploit kit JS/Axpergle and the rogue security software 
program JS/FakeCall were the most common malware families encountered 
in the US during the period. FakeCall is a detection for webpages that show 
a message falsely claiming the computer is infected with malware and 
offering to help clean it for a fee. FakeCall was significantly more common in 
the United States than in most of the rest of the world; it only ranked 38th 
worldwide.  

See “Threat families” beginning on page 85 for more information about 
commonly encountered malicious and unwanted software families. 

  The threat landscape in China is typically dominated by malware families 

that are much less common worldwide, and 1H16 was no exception. Several 
of the most prevalent threat families worldwide, including Axpergle, the 
browser modifier Win32/SupTab, and the software bundler Win32/Tillail, 
were not among the 100 most commonly encountered families in China in 
1H16. 

The most common threat family in China in 1H16 was  Win32/Xiazai, a 
Chinese-language browser modifier that ranked 35th worldwide. Other

unusually common threat families in China included the virus 
DOS/JackTheRipper (ranked fifth in China, 75th worldwide) and the browser 
modifiers Win32/Hao123 (tenth in China, 120th worldwide) and 
Win32/Riccietex (twelth in China, 137th worldwide). 

  The encounter rate in Brazil was about 50 percent higher 
than the worldwide encounter rate in 1H16. Encounters in 
Brazil were led by the cloud-based detection 
Win32/Spursint and the downloader/dropper family 
Win32/Banload. (See “Win32/Banload and Banking 
Malware” on page 21 of Microsoft Security Intelligence 
Report, Volume 19 (January–June 2015) for more 
information about Banload and related families in Brazil.) 
Threat families that were unusually common in Brazil 
included Banload (ranked second in Brazil, 63rd 
worldwide), the software bundler Win32/Fourthrem 
(eighth in Brazil, 77th worldwide), and the downloader 
family Win32/Sventore (11th in Brazil, 42nd worldwide). 

The threat 
landscape in China 
is typically 
dominated by 
malware families 
that are much less 
common 
worldwide. 

  The encounter rate in Russia was about 33 percent higher than the 

worldwide encounter rate in 1H16. Threat families that were unusually 
common in Russia in 1H16 included the software bundler Win32/DLHelper 
(ranked sixth in Russia, 52nd worldwide), the downloader family 
Win32/Ogimant (ranked eighth in Russia, 67th worldwide) and the browser 
modifier Win32/Neobar (ranked ninth in Russia, 40th worldwide). 

  The encounter rate in India was about 73 percent higher than the worldwide 

encounter rate in 1H16, led by the worm family Win32/Gamarue, which 
ranked first in India and fourth worldwide. Unusually common threat families 
in India included the virus family Win32/Sality (11th in India, 26th worldwide) 
and the worm family MSIL/Mofin (13th in India, 144th worldwide). 

  The encounter rate in Turkey was about 69 percent higher than the 

worldwide encounter rate in 1H16, led by Gamarue and the generic trojan 
detections Win32/Peals and Win32/Skeeyah. The trojan family 
Win32/BeeVry (11th in Turkey, 201st worldwide) was unusually common in 
Turkey, which accounted for about 95 percent of all BeeVry detections 
during 1H16. 

  The encounter rate in France was about 18 percent lower than worldwide 

encounter in 1H16. The overall mix of threats in France was similar to that of

accounted for about 10 percent of all Adposhel encounters in 
1H16. 

  The encounter rate in Germany was about 34 percent lower than the 

worldwide encounter rate in 1Q16. The most commonly encountered threat 
family in Germany during 1H16 was Win32/Bervisec, a software bundler 
distributed on German-language websites that was only the 87th most 
commonly encountered threat family worldwide. About 60 percent of all 
Bervisec encounters in 1H16 occurred in Germany. 

For a different perspective on threat patterns worldwide, Figure 46 shows the 
infection and encounter rates in locations around the world in 2Q16.

  As is frequently the case, exploit kits were relatively rare in the locations 

with the highest encounter rates. JS/Axpergle, the most commonly 

encountered exploit kit worldwide in 1H16 and the 10th most commonly 

encountered threat family overall, ranked no higher than 98th in any of 

the locations with the highest encounter rates. Exploit kits usually offer 

web-based control panels that enable attackers to 

target specific populations, such as geographic 

regions, operating system versions, browsers, and so 

on. The Angler kit (Axpergle) appears clearly to be 

targeted predominantly at wealthier countries and 

regions in Europe and the Americas, possibly 

because of a belief that computers in those areas 

have more valuable data to steal than in others. 

  Threat families that were unusually common in 

Mongolia include Win32/Lightmoon (ranked 12th in 

Mongolia, 241st worldwide), a mass-mailing worm

Some variants can disable system tools, log keystrokes, and take other 

malicious actions. Encounter rates for Lightmoon were more than three 

times as high in Mongolia as in any other country or region in 1H16. 

  Threat families that were unusually common in Myanmar include the 

worm families Win32/Macoute (first in Myanmar, 112th worldwide) and 

Win32/Conustr (eighth in Myanmar, 491st worldwide), and the virus 

family Win32/Madang (second in Myanmar, 226th worldwide). Macoute 

is a worm that can spread itself to removable USB drives, and may 

communicate with a remote host. Madang is a virus that infects .exe and 

.scr files, and connects to specific websites to possibly download other 

malware. Encounter rates for Madang were highest in Myanmar and 

Indonesia, which together accounted for about three-fourth of all 

Madang encounters worldwide. 

  Threat families that were unusually common in Vietnam included the 

software bundler Win32/Prepscram (ranked third in Vietnam, 57th 

worldwide) and the virus family DOS/Sigru (twelfth in Vietnam, 148th 

worldwide). Prepscram is often distributed as a mountable .iso disk file 

containing a software installer, which installs unwanted software 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   79 

alongside the desired applications. Vietnam accounted for about 20 

percent of all Prepscram encounters worldwide in 1H16. Sigru is a virus 

that can stop some files from working correctly in Windows XP and 

earlier operating systems. It spreads by infecting the master boot record 

(MBR) on connected hard disks and floppy disks. Vietnam accounted for 

about 40 percent of all Sigru encounters worldwide in 1H126, with China 

accounting for most of the rest. 

  Threat families that were unusually common in Pakistan included the 

worm families Win32/Ippedo (ranked third in Pakistan, 30th worldwide) 

and Win32/Nuqel (eighth in Pakistan, 71st worldwide). 

  Threat families that were unusually prevalent in Indonesia included the 

virus family Win32/Virut (ranked sixth in Indonesia, 48rd worldwide) and 

the worm family Win32/Copali (14th in Indonesia, 145th worldwide).

  The Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and 

Sweden, have perennially been among the healthiest locations in the world 
with regard to malware exposure, as has Japan. In 1H16, the infection and 
encounter rates for these locations were typically about half of the 
worldwide averages. 

  All of the locations shown in Figure 49 and Figure 50 had similar encounter 

and infection statistics in 1H16, with relatively few threat families that were 
particularly common or uncommon compared to the world as a whole. The 
adware program Win32/Adposhel, which ranked sixth in Norway and 11th in 
Denmark but only 37th worldwide, was an outlier. 

Threat categories 

The MMPC classifies individual threats into types based on a number of factors, 
including how the threat spreads and what it is designed to do. To simplify the 
presentation of this information and make it easier to understand, the Microsoft 
Security Intelligence Report groups these types into categories based on 
similarities in function and purpose.

software in 1H16, due to continued high encounter rates for the generic 
detections Win32/Dynamer, Win32/Peals, and Win32/Skeeyah, and to 
increased encounters involving Win32/Spursint and Win32/Lodbak. See 
“Threat families” beginning on page 85 for more information about these 
and other malicious and unwanted software families. 

  Worms remained the second most commonly encountered category, driven 

by the high encounter rate of Win32/Gamarue. 

  Encounters involving the Other Malware category increased in 1H16 to make 
it the third most commonly encountered category during the period, largely 
because of Win32/Hadsruda, a cloud-based detection for files that have 
been automatically determined to be malicious by Windows Defender. (See 
“Learning about new threats with cloud-based protection in Windows 
Defender” on page 73 for more information about cloud-based detections.)

  Encounters involving browser modifiers declined significantly in 1H16, driven 

by fewer detections of Win32/Diplugem and Win32/SupTab. See “Threat 
families” beginning on page 85 for more information about these and other 
malicious and unwanted software families. 

  Encounters involving software bundlers rose in 1Q16, primarily because of 

increased detections of Win32/Mizenota and Win32/Tillail, then fell in 2Q16 
as encounters involving those threat families receded. 

Threat categories by location 

Significant differences exist in the types of threats that affect users in different 
parts of the world. The spread of malware can be highly dependent on 
language and socioeconomic factors as well as on the methods used for 
distribution. Some threats are spread using techniques that target people who 
speak a particular language or who use online services that are local to a specific 
geographic region. Other threats target vulnerabilities or operating system 
configurations and applications that are unequally distributed around the world. 

Figure 53 shows the relative prevalence of different categories of malware in 
several locations around the world in 2Q16.

  Within each row of Figure 53, a darker color indicates that the category is 

more prevalent in the specified location than in the others and a lighter 
color indicates that the category is less prevalent. As in Figure 45 on page 
74, the locations in the table are ordered by number of computers reporting 
detections in 1H16. 

  Turkey and India had high encounter rates for Trojans, driven by a number 
of generic detections including Win32/Peals and Win32/Dynamer, and by 
Win32/Lodbak, associated with the worm family Win32/Gamarue. 

  Russia had a high encounter rate for Software Bundlers, led by 

Win32/DLHelper, which was unusually common in Russia in 2Q16. 

  Brazil had high encounter rates for Browser Modifiers, led by  

Win32/SupTab, and for Downloaders & Droppers, led by Win32/Banload. 

84  MALICIOUS AND UNWANTED SOFTWARE  

 

 

  The high encounter rate for viruses in China is driven by 

DOS/JackTheRipper, a destructive virus that affects versions of MS-DOS and 
Windows through Windows XP, but is ineffective against all currently 
supported Windows versions. JackTheRipper is a very old virus: the code 
contains a spurious copyright date of 1992, and samples have been 
collected in the wild since at least 1993 or 1994. 

  France, the United Kingdom, and Germany all had high encounter rates for 
Exploits, led by JS/Axpergle, and Adware, influenced by Win32/EoRezo and 
Win32/Adposhel. 

  The United States had a high encounter rate for Ransomware, led by 

Win32/Tescrypt.

23 Some threat families have multiple variants that belong to different categories. For each family, “most 
significant category” refers to the category with the highest encounter rate for the family during the period. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   85 

Figure 55. Encounter rate trends for a number of notable malicious software families in 1H16 

 

  Win32/Dynamer, Win32/Peals, and Win32/Skeeyah are generic detections 

for a variety of threats that share certain characteristics.  

  Win32/Gamarue, the most commonly encountered non-generic threat in 

1H16, is a worm that is commonly distributed via exploit kits and social 
engineering. Variants have been observed stealing information from the 
local computer and communicating with command-and-control (C&C) 
servers managed by attackers. Gamarue was especially prevalent in 
southern and southeast Asia, with India and Indonesia together accounting 
for about 25 percent of all Gamarue encounters during the period. Despite 
its prevalence worldwide, Gamarue was rarely detected in most countries 
and regions in North America and western Europe, including the United 
States, where it was only the 32nd most commonly encountered threat 
family in 1H16; Canada, where it ranked 51st; Russia, where it ranked 52nd; 
and France, where it ranked 70th. 

For more information about Gamarue, see the following entries in the 
MMPC blog at blogs.technet.com/mmpc:

 

JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit, is the only exploit-related 
family in the top ten in 1H16. See “Exploit kits” on page 54 for more 
information about Axpergle and other exploit kits. 

  Win32/Spursint is a cloud-based detection for files that 
have been automatically determined to be malicious by 
Windows Defender. (See “Learning about new threats 
with cloud-based protection in Windows Defender” on 
page 73 for more information about cloud-based 
detections.) Spursint disproportionately affected eastern 
Europe during 1H16, with the highest Spursint encounter 
rates coming from the former Soviet republics of 
Armenia, Belarus, and Ukraine. 

Win32/Gamarue 
was rarely detected 
in most countries 
and regions in 
North America and 
western Europe. 

  Win32/Lodbak is a trojan that is usually installed on removable drives by 

Gamarue, and which attempts to install Gamarue when the infected 
removable drive is connected to a computer. As might be expected, it tends 
to be encountered in the same geographic regions where Gamarue is most 
commonly found. 

  VBS/Jenxcus is a worm coded in VBScript that opens a backdoor on an 

infected computer, enabling an attacker to control it remotely. In addition to 
spreading via removable drives, Jenxcus is often transmitted via a fake 
Adobe Flash Player update from spoofed YouTube webpages. Encounters 
involving Jenxcus decreased significantly after the Microsoft Digital Crimes 
Unit launched a takedown operation in June of 2014 that successfully 
disrupted the Jenxcus botnet. The original owners of the botnet 
subsequently left the project, but the Jenxcus code is now being used by 
other criminal organizations.  

See “The Microsoft DCU and the legal side of fighting malware” on pages 
29–32 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 17 (January–June 
2014), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for more information 
about the Microsoft takedown of the Jenxcus botnet. For additional 
technical information about Jenxcus, see the following entries in the MMPC

  The declining encounter trends shown in Figure 57 follow an effort by 

Microsoft to focus on eradicating several specific highly common unwanted 
software families, particularly Win32/SupTab and Win32/Diplugem, which 
had been the two most commonly encountered unwanted software families 

                                                           
24 Microsoft has published the criteria that the company uses to classify programs as unwanted software at 
www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx. For programs that have been 
classified as unwanted software, Microsoft provides a dispute resolution process to allow for reporting of 
potential false positives and to provide software vendors with the opportunity to request investigation of a 
rating with which they do not agree.

in 2H15 by a large margin. SupTab is a browser modifier 
that installs itself and changes the browser’s default 
search provider without obtaining the user’s consent for 
either action. The SupTab authors shifted their focus to 
other malware after Microsoft added detections for the 
family in 3Q15, which likely explains much of the decline. 
Diplugem installs browser extensions without obtaining 
the user’s consent. The browser extensions show extra 
advertisements as the user browses the web and can 
inject additional advertisements into web search results 
pages. Diplugem encounters began to decline after 
detections for the family were added to the MSRT in 
October 2015, and remained significantly lower through 
1H16. 

Win32/SupTab is a 
browser modifier 
that installs itself 
and changes the 
browser’s default 
search provider 
without obtaining 
the user’s consent 
for either action. 

  Win32/Mizenota, the most commonly encountered unwanted software 

family in 1H16, is a software bundler that installs other unwanted software 
families, including SupTab and Sasquor. 

  Win32/Sasquor first appeared in early April and quickly became the second 
most commonly encountered unwanted software family in 2Q16. Sasquor is 
a browser modifier that modifies search and home page settings, and 
installs services and scheduled tasks to prevent the user from changing 
them back. It can also download additional malware, including SupTab and 
Win32/Xadupi. 

  Win32/OutBrowse is a software bundler that installs additional unwanted 

programs alongside software that the user wishes to install. It can remove or 
hide the installation program’s close button, leaving no option for users to 
close or decline the installation of offered applications.

Threat families by platform 

Malware does not affect all platforms equally. Some threats are spread by 
exploits that are ineffective against one or more operating system versions. 
Some threats are more common in parts of the world where specific platforms 
are more or less popular than elsewhere. In other cases, differences between 
platforms might be caused by simple random variation. 

Figure 59 and Figure 60 demonstrate how detections of the most prevalent 
malicious and unwanted software families in 2Q16 ranked differently on 
computers running different operating system versions.

* Includes Windows 8.1 

  Encounters involving JS/Axpergle, a detection for the Angler exploit kit and 
the only exploit-related family in the top ten in 1H16, were mostly confined 
to computers running Windows 7; although Axpergle ranked first on that 
platform, it ranked 22nd on Windows Vista and 13th on both Windows 8 
(including Windows 8.1) and Windows 10. The malicious webpages that 
exploit kits use to spread malware often include scripts that detect certain 
aspects of the computer’s computing environment and only present their 
exploits to computers that meet criteria specified by the attacker. The Angler 
exploit kit clearly affects Windows 7 far more than other platforms, which 
may partially be caused by the integration of Adobe Flash Player into 
Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and subsequent versions. The Angler exploit 
kit relies heavily on exploiting vulnerabilities in old, out-of-date versions of 
Flash Player, which must be installed as an add-on and updated separately 
from Internet Explorer in versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. Because 
Flash Player is integrated into Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and 
subsequent versions, it receives security updates through Windows Update 
and Microsoft Update along with other operating system components, 
which makes it easier for users to stay current on security updates for the 
component. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   91 

  Although the list of the most commonly encountered malicious software 

families was otherwise mostly consistent from platform to platform, 
Windows Vista is noticeably different. The remaining installed base for 
Windows Vista, the oldest currently supported client version of Windows, is 
very low relative to newer versions of Windows, and some of the variance 
seen in Figure 59 may be an artifact of the relatively small population of 
computers running Windows Vista. 

As Figure 60 illustrates, unwanted software is generally consistent between 
platforms as well.

  Unlike malicious software, unwanted software delivery mechanisms typically 

make little effort to distinguish between different platforms, and as a result 
the list of the most commonly encountered unwanted software families is 
similar on each supported platform. 

Ransomware 

Ransomware is a type of malware that is designed to render a computer or its 
files unusable until the computer user pays a certain amount of money to the 
attacker or takes other actions. Early ransomware families typically displayed 
what looked like official warnings from well-known law enforcement agencies, 
accusing the computer user of committing a computer-related crime and 
demanding that the user pay a fine via electronic money transfer or a virtual 
currency such as Bitcoin to regain control of the computer. In recent years, 
many of the more commonly encountered ransomware families have dropped 
the pretense of coming from law enforcement: they simply encrypt important 
files on the computer and offer to sell the user the private key to decrypt them.

Attackers often demand payment in Bitcoin, a popular virtual currency, or 
through other difficult-to-trace means.

  The location with the highest ransomware encounter rate in 2Q16 was Italy 

(0.82 percent), followed by Bulgaria (0.74 percent) and Taiwan (0.67 
percent). 

  Ransomware tends to target countries and regions that otherwise have 

relatively low infection rates. Italy, with the highest ransomware infection 
rate in the world, had an overall encounter rate of 18.8 percent in 2Q16, 
lower than the worldwide encounter rate of 21.2 percent. South Africa, with 
the fourth highest ransomware encounter rate in the world in 2Q16, had the 
lowest overall infection rate in Africa during the same period. 

Figure 63 displays encounter rate trends for several of the most commonly 
encountered ransomware families worldwide.

  Win32/Tescrypt, the most commonly encountered ransomware family 

 

worldwide in 1H16, is typically dropped by exploit kits such as Angler 
(Axpergle) and Sweet Orange (Anogre). It encrypts more than 180 different 
types of file by extension, and displays a demand for payment in Bitcoins to 
be paid to a dark website accessible via Tor. Encounter rates for Tescrypt 
were highest in Bulgaria (0.13 percent in 2Q16), Korea 
(0.13 percent), and Italy (0.12 percent). In May of 2016, the 
Tescrypt authors announced that they were ceasing 
operations and released the Tescrypt master key to the 
public. 

Win32/Locky en-
crypts and remains 
the victim’s files, 
and then replaces 
the desktop 
background with a 
demand for 
payment. 

  Win32/Locky was the second most commonly 

encountered ransomware family worldwide in 1H16. 
Encounter rates were highest in South Africa (0.13 
percent in 2Q16), Croatia (0.09 percent), and 
Luxembourg (0.09 percent). First detected in February 
2016, Locky is typically downloaded to computers via 
threats like JS/Nemucod and O97M/Donoff, which are 
spread by spam email messages, and by exploit kits such as Neutrino and 
RIG. After encrypting and renaming a victim’s files, Locky replaces the 
computer’s desktop background with a demand for payment in Bitcoins, 
and instructions for transmitting the payment to the attacker.

Locky searches for and encrypts more than 450 different types of file by 
extension. It is typically configured to avoid computers located in Russia or 
which use the Russian language, which gives a clue to its origins: attackers 
often try not to infect computers located in their home country or region, in 
an effort to avoid drawing attention from local authorities. Locky has been 
revised several times since its discovery in February to add code 
obfuscation, offline encryption, and other features. The Locky authors 
appear to use affiliates to distribute it, based on the presence of affiliate IDs 
found in the malware. 

For additional information about Locky, see the following entry in the MMPC 
blog (blogs.technet.com/mmpc): 

  The new .LNK between spam and Locky infection (October 19, 2016)  

  Win32/Cerber is another new ransomware family, which is often spread via 

the RIG (Meadgive) and Magnitude (Pangimop) exploit kits. Cerber is a 
ransomware-as-a-service family, sold to prospective attackers by its creators 
and designed to be easy to use by novices. Encounter rates for Cerber were 
highest in Qatar (0.10 percent in 2Q16), the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (0.09 percent), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (0.09 percent).

  Win32/Crowti (known as “CryptoWall” and “CryptoDefense”), the most 

commonly encountered ransomware family worldwide in 2H15, declined to 
much lower levels in 1H16 as its authors stopped actively distributing it. First 
detected in late 2013, Crowti is a file encrypting ransomware family that 
typically spreads through spam or is installed by downloader malware and 
exploits.  

Microsoft recommends that victims of ransomware infections not pay the so-
called fine. Ransomware is distributed by malicious attackers, not legitimate 
authorities, and paying the ransom is no guarantee that the attacker will restore 
the affected computer to a usable state. Microsoft provides free tools and 
utilities, such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner and Windows Defender Offline, 
that can help remove a variety of malware infections even if the computer’s 
normal operation is being blocked.  

See “Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 Anniversary Update” at 
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=837485 for information about new 
features designed to fight ransomware in the latest release of Windows 10, and 
visit www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/ransomware.aspx for 
more information about ransomware and how computer users can avoid being 
taken advantage of by this type of threat. 

Threats from targeted attackers 

Although using a real-time security software product from a reputable vendor 
and keeping the detection signatures up-to-date remains one of the best ways 
individuals and organizations can protect themselves against known threats, 
conventional antimalware software is often less effective against advanced 
attacks, such as those conducted by targeted attack groups. These groups, 
which focus on targeting computers at specific institutions, often use specially 
crafted threats that they test against popular antimalware solutions ahead of 
time to ensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures 
are available to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the 
organization. To help organizations combat such attacks, Office 365 Advanced 
Threat Protection, available with select Office 365 plans, provides an additional 
layer of defense against threats and malicious links that have never been 
encountered before. 

When an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous attached file, 
Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection launches it in a detonation chamber—a 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   97 

virtual sandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without 
posing harm to any other resources—and monitors it for suspicious behavior 
such as registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to 
executables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This 
monitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been 
seen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Some 
advanced threats avoid taking malicious actions when they determine they are 
beoing run in a virtual machine. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection includes 
anti-sandbox detection features to combat this behavior.

Excludes unknown file types. Totals for JavaScript and Other are incomplete due to a data collection error. 

  About 30 percent of the malicious files in Figure 66 were delivered inside 

container files, such as .zip and .rar files. 

  Microsoft Word files accounted for 38.5 percent of malicious files. Of these, 
the most common file extensions were .doc, used for the binary file format 
used in Word 97-2003, and .docm, used for Word documents that contain 
macros. 

 

JavaScript files accounted for the second largest type of file, at 30.6 percent 
of the total. JavaScript files also accounted for the overwhelming majority of 
malicious files contained within .zip files. Overall, about 70 percent of .js files 
attached to email messages were determined to be malicious, whether in a 
container file or not. 

  Executable files accounted for the third largest share of malicious files, at 

18.6 percent of the total. This type includes the familiar .exe extension used 
by most executable programs in Windows, along with a number of other 
extensions, such as .scr, .com, .pif, and .cpl. Executable files can provide an 
attacker with an easy way to compromise a computer without relying on 
exploiting a vulnerability, but most enterprise email servers and programs 
are configured to block them by default. 

  Microsoft Excel and URL files each accounted for a small percentage of the 

total.

common file extensions here were .eml, used by Microsoft Outlook to save 
email messages to disk; .wsf, used by the Windows Script Host; and .jar, a 
package format used for Java files. 

  PDF files, which have historically been a popular method for sending 

malware to targeted victims, accounted for only 0.9 percent of malicious file 
detections, as attackers have moved from embedding malware directly in 
PDF files to sending clean PDFs that contain links to malicious URLs. (See 
page 111 for information about malicious websites.) 

As Figure 67 demonstrates, the file types used for advanced threats changes 
significantly from month to month, as targeted attack groups shift between 
different victims and tactics.

  Detections of malicious Word files were highest in January and declined 

each month through May before rebounding in June. 

  Malicious JavaScript files accounted for more than half of the total in April, 

then retreated to much lower levels in the following months. 

  Malicious executables and Excel files were most common in May and June, 

respectively.

Potentially unwanted applications in the enterprise 

Microsoft has published the criteria used to classify programs as unwanted 
software at 
www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx. 
Characteristics of unwanted software can include depriving users of adequate 
choice or control over what the software does to the computer, preventing 
users from removing the software, or displaying advertisements without clearly 
identifying their source. Microsoft security products classify unwanted software 
as threats, and block or remove them when they are encountered. 

Some programs don’t meet the criteria to be considered unwanted software but 
still exhibit behaviors that may be considered undesirable, particularly in 
enterprise environments. Microsoft classifies these programs as potentially 
unwanted applications (PUA). For example, a program that displays additional 
advertisements in the browser might not be classified as unwanted software if it 
clearly identifies itself as the source of the ads, but may be considered 
potentially unwanted. Users often end up installing these programs because 
they were installing an application that they wanted, and the installer offered to 
install additional software—usually with the offer acceptance checked by default 
and often without the user realizing they are agreeing to install the additional 
software. These programs can also cause problems for network 
administrators—they can affect computer performance, increase the workload 
for the IT help desk, put computers and data at risk of being compromised 
through exploits, and make it more difficult to identify malware infections 
among the noise. To provide organizations with additional options for dealing 
with programs classified as PUA, Microsoft offers enterprise users of System 
Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP) the ability to block them from being installed 
on their networks. 

PUA statistics 

Figure 68 shows the PUA families blocked most often by SCEP in 2Q16. 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   101 

Figure 68. PUA families blocked in 2Q16  

 

  PUA:Win32/InstallCore and PUA:Win32/CandyOpen are detections for 
installer programs that were built with software bundler utilities (called 
InstallCore and OpenCandy, respectively) that offer monetization 
opportunities to software developers, such as pay-per-install services for 
programs that offer to download other programs alongside the requested 
application. The OpenCandy installer was frequently encountered bundled 
with μTorrent, a popular file-sharing program, and paint.net, an image and 
photo editing program. InstallCore was often bundled with audio and video 
file conversion programs. 

  PUA:Win32/AskToolbar and PUA:Win32/MyWebSearch are toolbar 

programs that are frequently offered for download with other programs 
through pay-per-install arrangements. 

  PUA:Win32/RelevantKnowledge is a tool used by a marketing research 

company to gather analytics about Internet usage from people who install 
the software. Like many of the other programs discussed in this section, it is 
often bundled with other software.

Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) or Microsoft Intune. For more 
information about creating a configuration item to enable PUA protection in 
System Center Configuration Manager, see How to Configure Endpoint 
Protection in Configuration Manager and Detect and block Potentially

already installed on the computer will not be removed. 

Security software use 

Recent releases of the MSRT collect and report details about the state of real-
time antimalware software on a computer, if the computer’s administrator has 
chosen to opt in to provide data to Microsoft. This telemetry data makes it 
possible to analyze security software usage patterns around the world and 
correlate them with infection rates. Figure 71 shows the percentage of 
computers worldwide that the MSRT found to be running up-to-date real-time 
security software each quarter in 2H15 and 1H16. 

Figure 71. Average monthly percentage of computers reporting security software enabled, 3Q15–2Q16 

 

  More than 80 percent of computers reported having real-time security 
software enabled during each of the past four quarters, increasing to 88 
percent by 2Q16. Much of the increase corresponds to increased adoption 
of Windows 10, which comes with Windows Defender installed and 
automatically enabled if no other security software is present, replacing 
installations of older versions of Windows that did not have this feature.

Just as infection and encounter rates differ from one country or region to 
another, so do security software usage rates, as shown in Figure 72. 

Figure 72. Average security software protection state for the locations with the most computers executing the MSRT in 1H16 

 

  All of the locations in Figure 72 reported at least 80 percent of computers 

protected by real-time security software in 1H16, ranging from 83.8 percent 
in Russia to 91.5 percent in Germany. 

 

In addition, all of these locations except Russia exceeded the worldwide 
average protection rate in 2H16. 

The rate of security software usage in a country or region often correlates with 
its infection rate. Figure 73 shows the percentage of computers in different 
countries and regions that reported being protected in 2Q16.

93.9 percent each month in 2Q16; Denmark, at 92.3 percent; and Norway, at 
92.2 percent.  

  Locations with the fewest computers reporting as fully protected include 

Libya, at 68.0 percent; Kyrgyzstan, at 77.3 percent; and Algeria, at 78.5

shown in Figure 48 on page 78. 

Security software use by platform 

Protection rates can also vary by operating system, as shown in Figure 75.

Figure 75. Average monthly security software protection state for supported client versions of Windows in 1H16, by quarter 

* Includes Windows 8.1 

 

 

In general, computers running newer versions of Windows tended to report 
being unprotected less often than computers running older versions. 

  The high rate of protection with Windows 10 is primarily because of a 

change in the way Windows Defender operates. To provide Windows 10 
users with protection from malware out of the box, Windows Defender is 
automatically activated upon installation of Windows 10 if no other real-time 
security product is installed, as opposed to a few days after installation in 
Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. 

The reasons computers go unprotected can vary significantly by platform, as 
Figure 76 illustrates.

* Windows Vista and Windows 7 do not report expired subscriptions. 

  On Windows Vista and Windows 7, unprotected computers predominantly 

report having no antimalware software installed at all. On subsequent 
Windows versions, Windows Defender is enabled by default if no other 
antimalware software is present, so the number of computers reporting no 
antimalware software is very low. 

  On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, expired versions of commercial 

antimalware products that are no longer receiving signature updates 
account for the largest percentage of unprotected computers. 

  On Windows 10, out-of-date signatures were the most common reason 

computers lacked protection. Expired subscriptions accounted for a very low 
percentage of unprotected computers running Windows 10, possibly 
reflecting both increased use of Windows Defender and new computers 
with pre-installed trial subscriptions of commercial antimalware products 
that had yet to expire during the period. Computers on which real-time 
monitoring had been temporarily turned off, or “snoozed,” accounted for 
the second highest share.

Malicious websites 

Attackers often use websites to conduct phishing attacks or 
distribute malware. To help protect users from malicious 
webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have 
developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and 
phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users 
try to navigate to them.  

Malicious websites often appear to be completely legitimate, and provide no 
outward indicators of their malicious nature even to experienced computer 
users. In many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been 
compromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques in efforts by 
attackers to take advantage of the trust users have invested in such sites. In 
other cases, attackers run their own sites and use social engineering to draw in 
traffic. 

The information in this section is compiled from a variety of sources, including 
telemetry data produced by SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer versions 8 
through 11 and Microsoft Edge, from a database of known active phishing and 
malware hosting sites reported by users of Internet Explorer and other Microsoft 
products and services, and from malware data provided by Microsoft 
antimalware technologies. (See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 137 for 
more information about the products and services that provided data for this 
report.)

Phishing sites 

Microsoft gathers information about phishing sites and impressions from 
phishing impressions that are generated by users who choose to enable 
SmartScreen Filter.25 A phishing impression is a single instance of a user 
attempting to visit a known phishing site with SmartScreen Filter enabled and 
being warned, as illustrated in Figure 78.

strongly with each other. Phishers sometimes engage in campaigns that 
temporarily drive more traffic to each phishing page without necessarily 
increasing the total number of active phishing pages they maintain at the 
same time. Nevertheless, both sites and impressions remained remarkably 
stable throughout 1H16, with neither one varying more than about 5 percent 
from the period average.  

Target institutions 

Some types of sites tend to consistently draw many more impressions per site 
than others. Figure 80 shows the breakdown of phishing impressions by 
category as reported by SmartScreen Filter. 

Figure 80. Phishing sites and impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter for each type of phishing site in 1H16 

 

  Phishing sites that targeted online services received the largest share of 
impressions during the period, and accounted for the largest number of 
active phishing URLs. 

  Financial institutions have always been popular phishing targets because of 

their potential for providing direct illicit access to victims’ bank accounts. 
Sites that targeted financial institutions accounted for the second largest 
share of both attacks and impressions.

Global distribution of phishing sites and clients 

Phishing impression information from SmartScreen Filter includes anonymized 
information about the IP addresses of the clients making the reports, as well as 
the IP addresses of the phishing sites themselves. Performing geographic 
lookups on these addresses makes it possible to analyze patterns among both 
the computers that host phishing sites and the users that they target.

Malware hosting sites 

SmartScreen Filter helps provide protection against sites that are known to host 
malware, in addition to phishing sites. SmartScreen Filter uses file and URL 
reputation data and Microsoft antimalware technologies to determine whether 
sites distribute unsafe content. As with phishing sites, Microsoft collects 
anonymized data regarding how many people visit each malware hosting site 
and uses the information to improve SmartScreen Filter and to better combat 
malware distribution.

  Monthly malware impressions more than tripled from January to June due 

to several factors, including aggressive campaigns by attackers and 
improved detection and classification by SmartScreen Filter. In 2015, the 
MMPC updated its malware evaluation criteria to include ads that are 
deceptive and misleading, which are now classified as malware by 
SmartScreen Filter and blocked. Over the past year, the volume of ads that 
meet these criteria has increased, including an emerging subset designed to 
take advantage of users seeking technical support.

  Locations with unusually low malware impression rates included Korea 

(112.0), Japan (206.9), and Slovenia (311.3). 

Drive-by download sites 

A drive-by download site is a website that hosts one or more exploits that target 
vulnerabilities in web browsers and browser add-ons. Users with vulnerable 
computers can be infected with malware simply by visiting such a website, even 
without attempting to download anything. 

Drive-by download pages are usually hosted on legitimate websites to which an 
attacker has posted exploit code. Attackers gain access to legitimate sites 
through intrusion or by posting malicious code to a poorly secured web form, 
like a comment field on a blog. Compromised sites can be hosted anywhere in 
the world and concern nearly any subject imaginable, making it difficult for even 
an experienced user to identify a compromised site from a list of search results. 

Figure 87. One example of a drive-by download attack 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   119 

 

Search engines such as Bing have taken a number of measures to help protect 
users from drive-by downloads. As Bing indexes webpages, they are assessed 
for malicious elements or malicious behavior. Because the owners of 
compromised sites are usually victims themselves, the sites are not removed 
from the Bing index. Instead, clicking the link in the list of search results displays 
a prominent warning, saying that the page may contain malicious software, as 
shown in Figure 88.

Guidance: Protecting users from unsafe websites 

One of the best ways organizations can protect their users from malicious and 
compromised websites is by mandating the use of web browsers with 
appropriate protection features built in and by promoting safe browsing 
practices. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security solutions” at

Malware at Microsoft: 
Dealing with threats in the 
Microsoft environment 

Microsoft IT  

Microsoft IT provides information technology services internally for Microsoft 
employees and resources. Microsoft IT manages more than 600,000 devices for 
more than 150,000 users across more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. 
Safeguarding a computing infrastructure of this size requires implementation of 
strong security policies, technology to help keep malware off the network and 
away from mission-critical resources, and dealing with malware outbreaks swiftly 
and comprehensively when they occur. 

This section of the report compares the potential impact of malware to the levels 
of antimalware compliance from more than 600,000 workstation computers and 
devices managed by Microsoft IT between January and June 2016. This data is 
compiled from multiple sources, including Windows Defender, System Center 
Endpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Event Forwarding (WEF), DirectAccess, 
forensics, and manual submission of suspicious files. Comparing the nature and 
volume of the malware detected on these computers to the level of protection 
they receive can illustrate significant trends and provide insights as to the 
effectiveness of antimalware software and security best practices. 

Antimalware usage 

Real-time antimalware software is required on all user devices that connect to 
the Microsoft corporate network. Windows Defender and System Center 
Endpoint Protection 2012 (SCEP) are the antimalware solutions that Microsoft IT 
deploys to its users. To be considered compliant with antimalware policies and 
standards, user computers must be running the latest version of the Defender or 
SCEP client, antimalware signatures must be no more than six days old, and 
real-time protection must be enabled.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   123 

Figure 90 shows the level of antimalware compliance in the Microsoft user 
workstation environment for each month in 1H16. 

Figure 90. Percentage of computers at Microsoft running real-time antimalware software each month in 1H16 

 

The average monthly compliance rate at Microsoft exceeded 97.8 percent each 
month during the first half of the year, reaching a high of 98.8 percent in June. In 
any network of this size, it is almost inevitable that a small number of computers 
will be in a noncompliant state at any given time. In most cases, these are 
computers that are being rebuilt or are otherwise in a state of change when 
online, rather than computers that have had their antimalware software 
intentionally disabled.  

Microsoft IT believes that a compliance rate in excess of 97.8 percent among 
approximately half a million computers is an acceptable level of compliance. In 
most cases, attempting to boost a large organization’s compliance rate the rest 
of the way to 100 percent will likely be a costly endeavor, and the end result—
100 percent compliance—will be unsustainable over time. 

Malware detections 

Figure 91 shows the categories of malicious and unwanted software that were 
most frequently detected at Microsoft in 1H16.

Figure 91. Top categories of malicious and unwanted software detected by Windows Defender and System Center Endpoint 
Protection at Microsoft in 1H16 

 

In this section, malware detections are defined as files and processes flagged by 
SCEP, regardless of the success or failure of automated containment or 
remediation. Malware detections are a measure of attempted malware activity, 
and do not necessarily indicate that a computer has been successfully infected. 
(Note that the methodology for assessing encounters used elsewhere in this 
report counts unique computers with detections, an approach that differs from 
the methodology used in this section, in which individual detections are 
counted. For example, if a computer encountered one trojan family in February 
and another one in June, it would only be counted once for the purposes of 
figures such as Figure 51 on page 82. In the preceding Figure 91, it would be 
counted twice, once for each detection.) 

Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) accounted for the largest number of 
detections, with twice as many detections as the next most prevalent category. 
The large number of PUA detections is the result of Microsoft using the new PUA-
blocking features in System Center Endpoint Protection to keep such programs 
out of enterprise networks. (See “Potentially unwanted applications in the 
enterprise” on page 101 for more information about this feature.) 

Figure 92 shows the top 10 file types among threat detections at Microsoft in 
1H16.

Executable program files with the .exe extension were the most commonly 
detected type of malicious file at Microsoft in 1H16. Malicious files with the .temp 
extension, typically used for temporary files, were the next most common type 
of threats, followed by .dll. 

Transmission vectors 

Examining the processes targeted by malware can help illustrate the methods 
that attackers use to propagate it. Figure 93 lists the top five transmission 
vectors used by the malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H16.

followed by cloud backup and storage services and web browsing. Non-
operating-system tasks were fourth, followed by developing tools. 

Malware infections 

Because almost all of the computers at Microsoft run real-time security software 
at all times, most infection attempts are detected and blocked before they are 
able to infect the target computer. When Defender or SCEP do disinfect a 
computer, it is usually because the software’s signature database has been 
updated to enable it to detect a threat that it did not recognize when the 
computer first encountered the threat. This lack of recognition may be because 
the threat is a new malware family, a new variant of a known family, a known 
variant that has been encrypted or otherwise repackaged to avoid detection, or 
because of some other reason. The MMPC constantly analyzes malware 
samples submitted to it, develops appropriate detection signatures, and deploys 
them to customers who use SCEP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows 
Defender. 

Figure 94 shows the most commonly detected categories of malicious and 
unwanted software that SCEP and Defender removed from computers at 
Microsoft in 1H16.

in 1H16. For example, exploits, which accounted for more than 300,000 
detections at Microsoft in 1H16, was not discovered infecting a single computer 
internally during the period. Most of the other categories also show clear 
differences between Figure 91 and Figure 94, although the ordering in the latter 
chart is significantly influenced by the low volumes involved. 

Figure 95 shows the top 10 file types used by malware to infect computers at 
Microsoft in 1H16. 

Figure 95. Infections and removals at Microsoft in 1H16, by file type 

 

Figure 95 is important because it provides information about threats that 
Defender and SCEP did not detect when they were first encountered—and 
therefore provides a clue about the areas in which malware authors have been 
focusing their efforts in recent months. Almost half of the malicious files 
removed from computers at Microsoft by Defender and SCEP in 1H16 had the 
extension .doc, used for Microsoft Word binary files. The .js extension used by 
JavaScript script files was next, followed by malicious .exe files. Nine extensions 
accounted for the remaining files, with seven extensions accounting for a single 
file each.

What IT departments can do to protect their users 

  Evaluate commercially available management tools, develop a plan, and 

implement a third-party update mechanism to disseminate non-Microsoft 
updates. 

  Ensure that all software deployed on computers in the environment is 

updated regularly. If the software provider offers an automatic update utility 
similar to Microsoft Update, ensure that it is enabled by default. See 
“Windows Update: FAQ” at support.microsoft.com for instructions on 
enabling automatic updates of Microsoft software. 

  Ensure that SmartScreen Filter is enabled in Microsoft Edge and Internet 

Explorer. See “SmartScreen Filter: FAQ” at support.microsoft.com for more 
information.  

  Use Group Policy to enforce configurations for Windows Update, Windows 

Firewall, and SmartScreen Filter. See Knowledge Base article KB328010 at 
support.microsoft.com, and “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security 
Deployment Guide” and “Manage Privacy: SmartScreen Filter and Resulting 
Internet Communication” at technet.microsoft.com for instructions. 

  Set the default configuration for antimalware to enable real-time protection 

across all drives, including removable devices. 

  Enable Windows Defender Cloud Protection in Windows 10 to automatically 

send information about suspicious files and behaviors to the Windows 
Defender Cloud, which can help identify and block threats during the first 
critical hours of an attack. For information about using Group Policy to 
enable cloud-based protection throughout your organization, see 
Configure Windows Defender in Windows 10 at Microsoft TechNet.

Appendix A: Threat naming 
conventions 

Microsoft names the malware and unwanted software that it detects according 
to the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) Malware naming 
scheme.  

This scheme uses the following format:  

Figure 97. The Microsoft malware naming convention 

 

When Microsoft analysts research a particular threat, they will determine what 
each of the components of the name will be. 

Type 

The type describes what the threat does on a computer. Worms, trojans, and 
viruses are some of the most common types of threats Microsoft detects. 

Platform 

The platform refers to the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, and 
Android) that the threat is designed to work on. Platforms can also include 
programming languages and file formats.  

Family 

A group of threats with the same name is known as a family. Sometimes 
different security software companies use different names.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   135 

Variant letters 

Variant letters are used sequentially for each different version or member of a 
family. For example, the detection for the variant “.AF” would have been created 
after the detection for the variant “.AE.”  

Additional information 

Additional information is sometimes used to describe a specific file or 
component that is used by another threat in relation to the identified threat. In 
the preceding example, the !lnk indicates that the threat is a shortcut file used by 
the Backdoor:Win32/Caphaw.D variant, as shortcut files usually use the 
extension .lnk. 

136 APPENDIX A: THREAT NAMING CONVENTIONS  

 

 

Appendix B: Data sources 

Data included in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is gathered from a 
wide range of Microsoft products and services whose users have opted in to 
provide usage data. The scale and scope of this telemetry data allows the report 
to deliver the most comprehensive and detailed perspective on the threat 
landscape that is available in the software industry:  

  Azure Security Center is a service that helps organizations prevent, detect, 
and respond to threats by providing increased visibility into the security of 
cloud workloads and using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to 
detect attacks. 

  Bing, the search and decision engine from Microsoft, contains technology 

that performs billions of webpage scans per year to seek out malicious 
content. After such content is detected, Bing displays warnings to users 
about it to help prevent infection. 

  Exchange Online is the Microsoft-hosted email service for business. 
Exchange Online antimalware and antispam services scan billions of 
messages every year to identify and block spam and malware.   

  The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) is a free tool that Microsoft 
designed to help identify and remove specific prevalent malware families 
from customer computers. The MSRT is primarily released as an important 
update through Windows Update, Microsoft Update, and Automatic 
Updates. A version of the tool is also available from the Microsoft Download 
Center. The MSRT was downloaded and executed more than 600 million 
times each month on average in 1H16. The MSRT is not a replacement for an 
up-to-date real-time antivirus solution.  

  The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that 
provides on-demand scanning and helps remove malware and other 
malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for an 
up-to-date antivirus solution, because it does not offer real-time protection 
and cannot prevent a computer from becoming infected.  

  Microsoft Security Essentials is a free, easy-to-download real-time 

protection product that provides basic, effective antivirus and antispyware 
protection for Windows Vista and Windows 7.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   137 

  Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection (formerly Forefront Client 

Security and Forefront Endpoint Protection) is a unified product that 
provides protection from malware and unwanted software for enterprise 
desktops, laptops, and server operating systems. It uses the Microsoft 
Malware Protection Engine and the Microsoft antivirus signature database 
to provide real-time, scheduled, and on-demand protection. 

  Office 365 is the Microsoft Office subscription service for business and home 

users. Select business plans include access to Office 365 Advanced Threat 
Protection. 

  SmartScreen Filter, a feature in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, offers 

users protection against phishing sites and sites that host malware. Microsoft 
maintains a database of phishing and malware sites reported by users of 
Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and other Microsoft products and 
services. When a user attempts to visit a site in the database with the filter 
enabled, the browser displays a warning and blocks navigation to the page. 

  Windows Defender in Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 provides 

real-time scanning and removal of malware and unwanted software. 

  Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection is a new service built into 

Windows 10 Anniversary Update that enables enterprise customers to 
detect, investigate, and remediate advanced persistent threats and data 
breaches on their networks. 

  Windows Defender Offline is a downloadable tool that can be used to create 
a bootable CD, DVD, or USB flash drive to scan a computer for malware and 
other threats. It does not offer real-time protection and is not a substitute 
for an up-to-date antimalware solution.

Glossary 

For additional information about these and other terms, visit the MMPC glossary 
at www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/mmpc/shared/glossary.aspx. 

account credentials 
Information presented to a service provider to verify that the holder of the 
credentials is authorized to access an account. Account credentials typically take 
the form of user names paired with passwords, but other forms of identification 
are possible. 

ActiveX control 
A software component of Microsoft Windows that can be used to create and 
distribute small applications through Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls can be 
developed and used by software to perform functions that would otherwise not 
be available using typical Internet Explorer capabilities. Because ActiveX controls 
can be used to perform a wide variety of functions, including downloading and 
running programs, vulnerabilities discovered in them may be exploited by 
malware. In addition, cybercriminals may also develop their own ActiveX 
controls, which can do damage to a computer if a user visits a webpage that 
contains the malicious ActiveX control. 

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) 
A security feature in recent versions of Windows that randomizes the memory 
locations used by system files and other programs, which makes it harder for an 
attacker to exploit the system by targeting specific memory locations. 

adware 
A program that displays advertisements. Although some adware can be 
beneficial by subsidizing a program or service, other adware programs may 
display advertisements without adequate consent. 

ASLR 
See Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). 

backdoor trojan  
A type of trojan that provides attackers with remote unauthorized access to and 
control of infected computers. Bots are a subcategory of backdoor trojans. Also 
see botnet.  

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   145 

Bitcoin 
A form of digital currency. Bitcoins can be used to buy things online or exchange 
them for real money. 

botnet  
A set of computers controlled by a command-and-control (C&C) computer to 
execute commands as directed. The C&C computer can issue commands 
directly (often through Internet Relay Chat [IRC]) or by using a decentralized 
mechanism, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Computers in a botnet are 
often called bots, nodes, or zombies.  

buffer overflow  
An error in an application in which the data written into a buffer exceeds the 
current capacity of that buffer, thus overwriting adjacent memory. Because 
memory is overwritten, unreliable program behavior may result and, in certain 
cases, allow arbitrary code to run.  

C&C  
See command and control (C&C).  

CCM  
Short for computers cleaned per mille (thousand). The number of computers 
cleaned for every 1,000 executions of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal 
Tool (MSRT). For example, if the MSRT has 50,000 executions in a particular 
location in the first quarter of the year and removes infections from 200 
computers, the CCM for that location in the first quarter of the year is 4.0 (200 ÷ 
50,000 × 1,000). Also see encounter rate. 

clean  
To remove malware or potentially unwanted software from an infected 
computer. A single cleaning can involve multiple disinfections.  

cloud-based detection 
A detection signature that detects files that have been automatically identified as 
malicious through the cloud-based protection feature of Windows Defender.  

command and control (C&C) 
A server that acts as a command center for one or more compromised 
computers. Botnet operators use C&C servers to issue commands to computers 
in the botnet. 

146 GLOSSARY  

 

 

credentials 
See account credentials. 

cross-site scripting  
Abbreviated XSS. An attack technique in which an attacker inserts malicious 
HTML and JavaScript into a vulnerable Web page, often in an effort to distribute 
malware or to steal sensitive information from the Web site or its visitors. 
Despite the name, cross-site scripting does not necessarily involve multiple 
websites. Persistent cross-site scripting involves inserting malicious code into a 
database used by a web application, potentially causing the code to be 
displayed for large numbers of visitors.  

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) 
A security technique designed to prevent buffer overflow attacks. DEP enables 
the system to mark areas of memory as non-executable, which prevents code in 
those memory locations from running. 

DDoS 
See distributed denial of service (DDoS). 

DEP 
See Data Execution Prevention (DEP). 

detection signature  
A set of characteristics that can identify a malware family or variant. Signatures 
are used by antimalware products to determine whether a file is malicious or 
not. Also see definition.  

detonation chamber 
A sandbox environment in which potentially dangerous files can be 
automatically launched and monitored for possible malicious activity. 

disclosure  
Revelation of the existence of a vulnerability to a third party.  

disinfect  
To remove a malware or potentially unwanted software component from a 
computer or to restore functionality to an infected program. Compare with 
clean.  

distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
A form of denial of service (DoS) that uses multiple computers to attack the 
target. Considerable resources may be required to exhaust a target computer 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   147 

and cause it to fail to respond. Often multiple computers are used to perform 
these types of malicious attack and increase the attack’s chances of success. This 
can occur, for example, when a number of compromised computers, such as 
those that comprise a botnet, are commandeered and ordered to access a 
target network or server over and over again within a small period of time. 

DNS 
See Domain Name System. 

Domain Name System 
The infrastructure used for name resolution on the Internet. It comprises a 
hierarchical collection of name servers which translate alphanumeric domain 
names to numeric IP addresses, and vice versa. 

downloader 
See downloader/dropper.  

downloader/dropper  
A form of trojan that installs other malicious files to a computer that it has 
infected, either by downloading them from a remote computer or by obtaining 
them directly from a copy contained in its own code.  

dropper 
See downloader/dropper. 

encounter 
An instance of security software detecting a threat and blocking, quarantining, 
or removing it from the computer. 

encounter rate 
The percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time security software that 
report detecting malware or potentially unwanted software, or report detecting 
a specific threat or family, during a period. Also see infection rate. 

exploit  
Malicious code that takes advantage of software vulnerabilities to infect a 
computer or perform other harmful actions.  

exploit kit 
A collection of exploits bundled together and sold as commercial software. A 
typical kit contains a collection of web pages that contain exploits for 
vulnerabilities in popular web browsers and add-ons, along with tools for 
managing and updating the kit. 

148 GLOSSARY  

 

 

firewall  
A program or device that monitors and regulates traffic between two points, 
such as a single computer and the network server, or one server to another.  

generic  
A type of signature that is capable of detecting a variety of malware samples 
from a specific family, or of a specific type.  

hash 
Text that has been encoded using a one-way cryptographic function that 
prevents it from being decrypted. Also refers to a checksum produced by a hash 
function to identify or authenticate data. 

heuristics 
A tool or technique that can help identify common patterns. This can be useful 
for making generic detections for a malware family. 

IFrame  
Short for inline frame. An IFrame is an HTML document that is embedded in 
another HTML document. Because the IFrame loads another webpage, it can be 
used by criminals to place malicious content, such as a script that downloads 
and installs spyware, into non-malicious HTML pages that are hosted by trusted 
websites.  

in the wild  
Said of malware that is currently detected on active computers connected to the 
Internet, as compared to those confined to internal test networks, malware 
research laboratories, or malware sample lists.  

infection 
The presence of malware on a computer, or the act of delivering or installing 
malware on a computer. Also see encounter. 

infection rate 
See CCM. 

jailbreaking 
See rooting. 

Malicious Software Removal Tool 
A free tool that Microsoft designed to help identify and remove specific 
prevalent malware families from customer computers. An updated version of 
the tool is released each month through Windows Update and other updating 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   149 

services. The MSRT is not a replacement for an up-to-date real-time antivirus 
solution. 

malware  
Short for malicious software. The general name for programs that perform 
unwanted actions on a computer, such as stealing personal information. Some 
malware can steal banking details, lock a computer until the user pays a ransom, 
or use the computer to send spam. Viruses, worms and trojans are all types of 
malware. 

malware impression 
A single instance of a user attempting to visit a page known to host malware and 
being blocked by SmartScreen Filter in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. Also 
see phishing impression. 

man-in-the-middle attack 
A form of eavesdropping in which a malicious hacker gets in the middle of 
network communications. The malicious hacker can then manipulate messages 
or gather information without the people doing the communication knowing. 

monitoring tool  
Software that monitors activity, usually by capturing keystrokes or screen 
images. It may also include network sniffing software. Also see password stealer 
(PWS).  

MSRT 
See Malicious Software Removal Tool. 

P2P 
See peer-to-peer (P2P). 

password stealer (PWS)  
Malware that is specifically used to transmit personal information, such as user 
names and passwords. A PWS often works in conjunction with a keylogger. Also 
see monitoring tool.  

payload  
The actions conducted by a piece of malware for which it was created. Payloads 
can include, but are not limited to, downloading files, changing system settings, 
displaying messages, and logging keystrokes.  

150 GLOSSARY  

 

 

peer-to-peer (P2P) 
A system of network communication in which individual nodes are able to 
communicate with each other without the use of a central server. 

phishing  
A method of credential theft that tricks Internet users into revealing personal or 
financial information online. Phishers use phony websites or deceptive email 
messages that mimic trusted businesses and brands to steal personally 
identifiable information (PII), such as user names, passwords, credit card 
numbers, and identification numbers.  

phishing impression  
A single instance of a user attempting to visit a known phishing page and being 
blocked by SmartScreen Filter in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. Also see 
malware impression. 

potentially unwanted application (PUA) 
A program that doesn't meet the criteria to be considered unwanted software, 
but still exhibits behaviors that may be considered undesirable, particularly in 
enterprise environments. 

PUA 
See potentially unwanted application (PUA). 

ransomware 
A type of malware that prevents use of a computer or access to the data that it 
contains until the user pays a certain amount to a remote attacker (the 
“ransom”). Computers that have ransomware installed usually display a screen 
containing information on how to pay the “ransom.” A user cannot usually 
access anything on the computer beyond the screen. 

rogue security software  
Software that appears to be beneficial from a security perspective but that 
provides limited or no security capabilities, generates a significant number of 
erroneous or misleading alerts, or attempts to socially engineer the user into 
participating in a fraudulent transaction.  

rooting 
Obtaining administrative user rights on a mobile device through the use of 
exploits. Device owners sometimes use such exploits intentionally to gain access 
to additional functionality, but these exploits can also be used by attackers to 
infect devices with malware that bypasses many typical security systems. The 

 

MICROSOFT SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT, VOLUME 21, JANUARY–JUNE 2016   151 

term “rooting” is typically used in the context of Android devices; the 
comparable process on iOS devices is more commonly referred to as 
jailbreaking. 

rootkit  
A program whose main purpose is to perform certain functions that cannot be 
easily detected or undone by a system administrator, such as hiding itself or 
other malware.  

sandbox 
A specially constructed portion of a computing environment in which potentially 
dangerous programs or processes may run without causing harm to resources 
outside the sandbox. 

SEHOP 
See Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP). 

signature 
See detection signature. 

social engineering  
A technique that defeats security precautions by exploiting human 
vulnerabilities. Social engineering scams can be both online (such as receiving 
email messages that ask the recipient to click the attachment, which is actually 
malware) and offline (such as receiving a phone call from someone posing as a 
representative from one’s credit card company). Regardless of the method 
selected, the purpose of a social engineering attack remains the same—to get 
the targeted user to perform an action of the attacker's choice.  

software bundler 
A program that installs unwanted software on a computer at the same time as 
the software the user is trying to install, without adequate consent. 

spam  
Bulk unsolicited email. Malware authors may use spam to distribute malware, 
either by attaching the malware to email messages or by sending a message 
containing a link to the malware. Malware may also harvest email addresses for 
spamming from compromised machines or may use compromised machines to 
send spam.  

152 GLOSSARY  

 

 

spear phishing 
Phishing that targets a specific person, organization, or group, containing 
additional information associated with that person, organization, or group to 
lure the target further into a false sense of security to divulge more sensitive 
information. 

spyware  
A program that collects information, such as the websites a user visits, without 
adequate consent. Installation may be without prominent notice or without the 
user’s knowledge.  

SQL injection 
A technique in which an attacker enters a specially crafted Structured Query
