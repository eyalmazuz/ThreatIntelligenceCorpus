A Fanny Equation: “I am your father, Stuxnet”
At the Virus Bulletin conference in 2010, researchers from Kaspersky Lab partnered with Microsoft to present findings  related to Stuxnet. The joint presentation included slides dealing with various parts of Stuxnet, such as the zero-days  used in the attack.
Perhaps the most interesting zero-day  exploit from Stuxnet was the LNK exploit (CVE-2010-2568). This allowed Stuxnet  to propagate through USB drives and infect even machines that had Autorun  disabled.
It was discovered during the 2010 research  into Stuxnet that the LNK exploit has earlier been used in another malware,  supposedly a Zlob PE, that pointed to “fanny.bmp“.
Back in 2010, very few people paid much  attention to a piece of malware that used the LNK exploit prior to Stuxnet.  Zlob is a large malware family and these kinds of crimeware-grade samples are  rarely of interest to researchers digging into zero-days and nation-state  sponsored operations.
However, during our 2014 research into the Equation group, we created a special detection for the group’s exploitation  library, codenamed “PrivLib”. To our surprise, this detection triggered a worm  from 2008 that used the Stuxnet LNK exploit to replicate, codenamed Fanny.
What’s so Fanny?
This PrivLib-boosted Worm, which spreads  using the Stuxnet LNK exploit and the filename “fanny.bmp” was compiled on Mon  Jul 28 11:11:35 2008, if we are to trust the compilation timestamp. It arrived  in our December 2008 collection from the wild, so the compilation might very  well be correct.

“Fanny my name” could be an introductory message from the authors
The 2008 “Fanny.bmp” Worm is detected by  Kaspersky Lab products as Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.bjqt.  The malware includes the LNK exploit, which means that it is a piece of  malicious software that used the Stuxnet LNK exploit before Stuxnet!
The second Stuxnet exploit (MS09-025)
If one piece of malicious software that  used an exploit from Stuxnet before Stuxnet is a good catch, a second Stuxnet  exploit makes it even more interesting.
The second exploit used to be a zero-day  when Fanny was operational. This means that Fanny used two zero-days to  replicate, both of which were later used by Stuxnet. The specific vulnerability  used for privilege escalation was patched with MS09-025:
The same exploit was later used in an early  Stuxnet module from 2009, which was embedded into a large binary built using  the Flame platform. That Stuxnet module, also known as “atmpsvcn.ocx” or Resource 207 was the technical link between  Stuxnet and Flame. This story has previously been covered in our post.
#Fanny used two zero-days to replicate, both of which were later used by #Stuxnet #EquationAPT #TheSAS2015
While the vulnerability exploited by both  the Stuxnet/Flame module and Fanny  is the same, the implementation of the exploit is different. The exploit in  Stuxnet targets a specific OS version, while Fanny is designed to be universal  and is capable of running on multiple platforms. It has a unique shellcode and  exploit-triggering procedures for:

Windows NT 4.0
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows 2003
Windows Vista, 2008 and possibly others from NT6.x family

Windows NT 4.0
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows 2003
Windows Vista, 2008 and possibly others from NT6.x family
The implementation of the exploit in Fanny  is more complex than in Stuxnet: instead of running just one payload the  authors created a framework to run as many payloads as they want by replacing a  system service call dispatcher nt!NtShutdownSystem with their own custom pointer from   theuser-space as shown in the next figure.

Fanny injected its own system service call dispatcher
This enables a persistent trampoline from  user-mode to kernel-mode. This feature was not present in the Stuxnet module  but there are other similarities. For instance, it seems that both the  developers of Stuxnet and of Fanny follow certain coding guidelines such as the  usage of unique magic numbers from each function call. Most of the returned  results are simply disposed but they are still part of the code. This could be  the remains of a debug version of the code which could potentially log every  step in the code to ease the tracking down of an error while testing. In  complex systems where kernel and user-space code is running with no interaction  this seems a logical and even essential method. Again, it’s implemented both in  the Stuxnet code and in Fanny. See next figure.

The Fanny Malware
So, what is Fanny essentially? It is a USB  Worm with a sophisticated backdoor that uses the so-called “Stuxnet LNK  vulnerability” to automatically execute from the USB drive even if Autorun has  been disabled. It can elevate privileges to the local System using kernel  exploit and drops and registers additional modules. It attempts to connect to a  C&C server and deploys additional components if connection is available. If  not, it uses the USB drive as a carrier  to send/receive requests to and from the operator via a hidden storage area  created in raw FAT structure.

Typically a victim plugs in a new USB drive  and opens it with Windows Explorer. You can visually observe the two stages of  infection from the USB which take seconds to execute.

Fanny modules



MD5
0a209ac0de4ac033f31d6ba9191a8f7a


Size
184320


Type
Win32 DLL


Internal name
dll_installer.dll


Compiled
2008.07.28    08:11:35 (GMT)



This file is a DLL with two exports (to  install and uninstall the malware). It contains a xor-encrypted config in  binary resource with number 101. The config determines malware behavior: there  is a command to deploy malware on the current system, URLs for the C&C  server and local filenames and paths used to install embedded malware  components.

Fanny components inside the main executable
Upon starting it checks the following  mutexes:

Global\RPCMutex
Global\RPCMutex 
			

Global\RPCMutex
Global\RPCMutex 
			
Where 
			 is a 1-byte long  integer taken from the config. If any of these mutexes exist, the code doesn’t  run. It means that another instance of the same code is running. InstanceNum  most likely identifies a variant or generation of Fanny preventing the same  version from reinfecting the system but allowing for different versions to run  (possibly to enable enforced update of components).
The module also checks another important  byte in its configuration. This byte is a counter that is decreased during  successful system infection. When the counter reaches a minimal value of one  the module cleans up the USB drive and stops spreading the worm. In this way  the attackers limit the maximum length of the Worm’s killchain.
If the module is named “fanny.bmp” (the file name that  Fanny uses to spread via USB drives) the module self-installs from the USB drive.
As part of the initial infection process  Fanny attempts to elevate current privileges if the user has no administrative  rights on the current system. It uses a vulnerability patched by MS09-025 for that purpose. Only if the  elevation succeeds does the malware attempt to connect to the C&C server  using a URL which is stored in the config:

http://webuysupplystore[.]mooo[.]com/ads/QueryRecord200586_f2ahx.html

http://webuysupplystore[.]mooo[.]com/ads/QueryRecord200586_f2ahx.html
Below is a sample request issued by the  malware:
The malware expects the C&C server to reply with an HTTP 200 response and append a 0x7f-xored string that has a  second stage URL. The second stage response may contain an executable file body  which is saved on disk and executed.
The C&C server is currently sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab, but according to our pDNS records it previously pointed to the following IP address:

210.81.22.239

210.81.22.239
IP information

The following describes the stages that  were identified during the analysis of the initial and embedded components of Fanny.
Infection
The module searches for fanny.bmp in the root of disk drives  starting from drive D: and copies it to the following locations:

%WINDIR%\system32\comhost.dll
%WINDIR%\system32\mscorwin.dll

%WINDIR%\system32\comhost.dll
%WINDIR%\system32\mscorwin.dll
Why does Fanny make two copies of itself?  Actually, there is a minor difference between these two files. Fanny patches  its config in the resource section of one of the files (comhost.dll). The  patched data is the value of remained maximum length of the Fanny killchain. “mscorwin.dll” is the original file  copied as-is from the removable drive. So far, one copy is used for infecting  other USB drives, the other is loaded on the system boot.
It also copies all *.lnk files from the USB  drive to “%WINDIR%\system32\” in  order to reuse them when infecting other attached USB drives. Note that there  may be more than one LNK file, because each LNK contains a distinct path to the  DLL which gets loaded. As far as the letter of a new drive on the target system  is unknown, Fanny uses several LNKs for the most common drive letters. This  method was improved later in Stuxnet, which used a relative DeviceID-dependent  path to the USB drive. However, even that method required several LNK files (up  to four) because of different relative paths on different versions of Windows,  but that’s far fewer than an almost full set of letters from the Latin  alphabet.
Persistence
Fanny creates the following registry value  to achieve persistence:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\Driver.
This is not a common way to make code start  automatically on a system boot and it’s extremely invasive, but it guarantees  that the module is loaded in the address space of each process in the system,  including some critical processes such as lsass.exe and services.exe running as SYSTEM user.

When the module is loaded it checks other  values that start from “filter”  in the same registry key, i.e.:

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter2
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter3
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter8

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter2
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter3
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\MediaResources\acm\ECELP4\filter8
The values contain a hosting process name  and a path to a DLL or EXE file. If the current process name contains the value  set as hosting process, then the module loads a DLL or starts a new process (in  case of EXE file) depending on target file extension.
This is a map of the processes and modules  that are used in Fanny:



Process
Fanny module
Short Description


winlogon
c:\windows\MSAgent\AGENTCPD.DLL
USB backdoor


explorer
c:\windows\system32\shelldoc.dll
Windows Explorer rootkit


lsass
c:\windows\system32\mscorwin.dll
USB worm



USB Worm
The code of the actual Worm is part of %WINDIR%\system32\comhost.dll export  with ordinal 4 (name of export is “dll_installer_4“).  The DLL is a modified next-generation Worm which is copied to every attached  USB drive with all related LNK files stored in Windows\System32 directory. This  module is distributed by mscorwin.dll which is part of the lsass system process.
Windows Explorer Rootkit
The rootkit functionality is provided by a shelldoc.dll file loaded in the Windows  Explorer process. It hides some Fanny-related files (LNK-files and fanny.bmp)  in Windows Explorer by removing them from the list of items in the foreground  window that uses SysListView32 control (normally Windows Explorer window).
Some screenshots with disappearing files  were demonstrated previously, however sometimes this approach may raise  suspicions. Here is what it looks like if the user opens a system32 directory  with Explorer:

Seven Fanny-related file icons disappeared in Windows Explorer
Apparently, it looks as if some of the file  icons were cut off. In addition some of standard directories seem to be missing  due to a bug in the rootkit code. It appears as if this component was not  tested properly by the authors.
Masquerade Mode On
There is an interesting part of the code in  USB Backdoor DLL which at first glance doesn’t make much sense. It takes some  hardcoded constants and generates a random value which is saved to a registry  key.

Fanny generates  random values that are saved to the registry
Then it moves the current executable which  is hosting the DLL to c:\windows\system32\msdtc32.exe.  After that the executable path is appended to HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell registry value which makes this executable run on system boot.
The trick to mimic the behavior of traditional malware was used to avoid revealing further secret activities #Fanny
This may look like a traditional way for  malware to add itself to autostart, but don’t be fooled by that. The purpose of  this move is to make certain automated systems and software, such as those based  on sandboxes and emulators, believe that they have caught some known malware  and not to let it run further. It seems that the component is so unique that  the authors decided to avoid the risk of looking even more suspect. It might  seem a paradox, but the authors prefer this code to be detected as malware if  someone is checking it. The trick is to mimic the behavior of some traditional  cybercriminal malware, a bot, and get detected as soon as possible, thereby not  revealing any further secret activities. Considering that this component was  spreading via USB drives and could pop up on many systems, discovering it as a  traditional bot would put it in lower risk zone and as a result the malware  would probably end up being deleted without proper analysis.
This might explain why this code was  detected as a variant of Zlob malware in the past and no one paid proper  attention to it.
USB Backdoor
One of the modules, agentcpd.dll, is a  backdoor that was designed to work as an advanced reconnaissance tool for  air-gapped computers that are normally used in highly secure facilities. The  backdoor waits for a USB drive to be plugged in and if that’s a new disk, it  instantly allocates some space for a hidden container using its own FAT16/FAT32  filesystem driver.
This is what the FAT root directory looks  like before and after plugging a USB drive into an infected machine:

Hexdump of raw  disk partition before and after plugging into an infected machine
On top of this hexdump the drive label  “MYDRIVE” can be found (corresponding hex bytes are underlined with  green). It is followed by a single byte flag value (0x08 in hex) which, according to Microsoft, means ATTR_VOLUME_ID. Each entry in this root  directory table is 32-bytes long.
Subdirectory entries such as Pictures,  Music, Documents and Work occupy 63 bytes, because of the long filename FAT  feature. There are two variants of subdirectory names – short and long. A  subdirectory entry uses a flag 0x10 following the short directory name, which, according to Microsoft, means ATTR_DIRECTORY.
The last record inserted by Fanny  (highlighted in red) uses an invalid directory name and a flag 0x18, which combines ATTR_VOLUME_ID and ATTR_DIRECTORY. This combination of flags is not documented  according to current FAT specifications and the whole entry is therefore  ignored by filesystem drivers as if it were a data corruption or a bad block.  As a result this entry is not visible in Windows, Mac OS and Linux and probably  all other implementations of FAT driver. 
It’s possible that #Fanny was used to map some of the future targets of #Stuxnet #EquationAPT #TheSAS2015
While Fanny doesn’t rigorously protect data  in hidden storage (it doesn’t mark the allocated space as bad blocks, probably  to avoid attention), it changes the filesystem driver hint value indicating  where to look for the next free cluster. In this way it reserves disk space of  approximately 1Mb in size to use for a hidden storage.
When Fanny detects a new USB drive, with  the help of its own FAT driver it looks into the root directory and locates the  entry which starts with magic value 51 50 40 98 (see above). It then uses the offset which follows the flag value  of 0x18. On the figure above it is set to 0x001e9c00. This offset on the same  USB disk will have another magic value D0  CF CE CD serving as a marker for the beginning of the hidden storage:

Hexdump of Fanny  hidden storage with list of running processes
Once Fanny has allocated space for hidden  storage it populates the storage with basic information about the current  system: i.e. OS Version, Service Pack number, computer name, user name, company  name, list of running processes, etc.
This secret storage is also used to pass  commands to computers that are not connected to the Internet. According to  Fanny code, the container may carry additional components and internal  commands: such as to copy certain file from the local filesystem to the USB  drive (locations are defined as parameters, the file is set hidden and system  file attributes), or to update the configuration block. It uses RC4 with the  following hard-coded key to protect critical information:
18  05 39 44 AB 19 78 88  C4 13 33 27 D5 10  6C 25
When the USB drive travels to another  infected computer connected to the Internet it can be used to carry important  files and provide a way to interact with the operator. This simple and  extremely slow method of communication is not used by traditional  cybercriminals, that is why the whole code looks like a toolkit for  professional cyberespionage. This component is one of the rare malware samples  from a new class of malware called USB-Backdoors.
If you find this or a similar code of  USB-Backdoor on some of your systems this is an indicator of a professional  cyberattack.
Sinkholing and victim  statistics
We sinkholed the Fanny C&C server and  collected victim statistics, shown below. In total, we observed over 11,200  unique IPs connecting to the sinkhole server over a period of five months:

At the moment, the vast majority of victims  are located in Pakistan (a whopping 59.36%). Indonesia and Vietnam follow at  great distance, with 15.99% and 14.17% respectively. The infection numbers in  other countries are probably too small to be relevant.
Of course, this could raise the question:  was Pakistan the true target of Fanny? To be honest, we do not know. The  current infection situation might be different from what it was in 2008-2010.  Considering that there are still over ten thousand victims worldwide, the  number back in 2009 might have been much, much higher – perhaps even as high  as  50,000 infections. It may be relevant  that Pakistan is a top target for the Equation group’s other malware, along  with Russia and Iran.
Conclusion
With Fanny, we begin yet another chapter in  the story of Stuxnet, the Equation Group and Flame. Created in 2008, Fanny used  two zero-day exploits. These two were added to Stuxnet in June 2009 and March  2010. Effectively, it means that the Equation group had access to these  zero-days (and others) years before the Stuxnet group did.
While the true target of Fanny remains  unknown, its unique capability to map air-gapped networks and communicate via  USB sticks indicate a lot of work went into gaining the ability to access these  air-gapped networks. As a precursor for the versions of Stuxnet that could  replicate through the network, it’s possible that Fanny was used to map some of  the future targets of Stuxnet.
Another unusual fact is the very high  number of infections coming from Pakistan. Since Fanny spreads only through USB  sticks, which is rather slow, this indicates that the infection began in  Pakistan, possibly before many other countries. 
Was Fanny used to map some highly sensitive  networks in Pakistan, for an unknown purpose, or was it used in preparation for  Stuxnet? Perhaps time will tell.

kaspersky implies that the “equation group” and the “stuxnet group” are two different groups, but i think that another possibility is that they are one and the same..
thanks for the article.. i was wondering about the “fanny.bmp” file and how a “BMP” file was being used.. apparently it is just copied to the harddrive, but with a different file-extension, making it usable for malicious purposes..

The only thing U.S is worried about Pakistan is Nuclear Power (well hidden). U.S seeking for locations of nuclear weapons in Pakistan to damage or de-nuking the country. Pakistan Intelligence told  that of all the things in the world to worry about, the issue you should worry about the least is the safety of our nuclear program,” the official said. Pakistan said no to U.S safety program. it’s wise for the U.S. to try to design a plan for seizing Pakistan’s nuclear weapons in a low and slow risk manner, ( Fanny ). Fanny also Failed….so they skip for second option, Iran.

I don’t think this one would be nuclear-focused. Remember who was living in Pakistan with a computer but no direct Internet connection pre-2011? Osama bin Laden.
