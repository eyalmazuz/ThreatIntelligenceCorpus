This report covers a campaign of phishing and malware which we have named 
“Operation Manul”  and which, based on the available evidence, we believe is likely to 
have been carried out on behalf of the government of Kazakhstan against journalists, 
dissidents living in Europe, their family members, known associates,  and their lawyers. 
Many of the targets are involved in litigation with the government of Kazakhstan in 
European and American courts whose substance ranges from attempts by the 
government of Kazakhstan to unmask the administrators behind an anonymous website 
that publishes leaks alleging government corruption (Kazaword)  to allegations of 
kidnapping. 
 
Our research suggests links between this campaign and other campaigns that have been 
attributed to an Indian security company called Appin Security Group. A hired actor is 
consistent with our findings on the Command and Control servers related to this 
campaign, which included web-based control panels for multiple RATs, suggesting that 
several campaigns were being run at once. A hired actor may also explain the generic and 
uninspired nature of the phishing, which often took the form of an email purporting to 
contain an invoice or a legal document with an attachment containing a blurry image. 
An investigation by the Swiss federal police of some of the emails linked to Operation 
Manul concludes that they were sent from IP addresses in India, which also suggests a 
link to Appin. 
 
Hundreds of leaked emails published on the Kazaword website also suggest possible links 
between this campaign and Arcanum Global Intelligence, a private intelligence company 
with headquarters in Zurich, which was allegedly hired by the government of Kazakhstan 
to perform a surveillance and data extraction operation against a high-profile dissident. 
It was ​Respublika’s
Kazakhstan to request an injunction in a New York court to bar the website from 
publishing the “stolen” emails.

In 2015, EFF’s clients in the​Respublika litigation were the targets of several spearphishing
 
 
attempts they had received via email (Fig. 1). We analyzed these emails and discovered
 
that they contained malware, which appeared to be coming from a single actor as part of
 
an ongoing targeted hacking campaign which we have named “Operation Manul.” Over
 
 
the last year Operation Manul has repeatedly targeted our clients in the ​Respublika case
 
(Irina Petrushova and Alexander Petrushov), their known associates and family members,
 
and other dissidents involved in litigation with the government of Kazakhstan in
 
Europeans courts,  as well as their family members, associates, and attorneys. 
 
We were also able to observe links between Operation Manul and a malware campaign
 
 
targeting the family of Mukhtar Ablyazov, co-founder of the Democratic Choice of
Kazakhstan, a party opposed to the ​authoritarian rule of Kazakhstan’s President
 
Nursultan Nazarbayev​. ​Ablyazov is currently fighting extradition from France, where he
 
 
 
lives in exile, to Nazarbayev-allied Russia. In May 2013, Ablyazov's wife, Alma
 
Shalabaeva, and 6-year-old daughter, Alua Ablyazova, were taken into custody by Italian
police and forcibly deported despite having legal British and European residence permits.
 
Within 72 hours, they were on a private jet hired by the Kazakh embassy, and taken to
 
Almaty, Kazakhstan’s capital. Ablyazov and his supporters have characterized this move
 
as a “kidnapping” and “political hostage-taking” ordered by President Nazabayev.
 
Spearphishing emails and malware sent to the family and their associates during this
 
period may have been intended to help track Alma and Alua’s movements in preparation
 
 
for this incident.

Invoice” may refer to Bolat Atabayev, a Khazakh dissident and theater director who was also
targeted in this campaign. 
 
 
In an appeal filed with a Swiss court earlier this year, members of Ablyazov’s family
allege that they have been targeted by a campaign of spearphishing emails containing
 
family, attorneys, and
malware going back to 2012. The campaign against Ablyazov’s
 
associates used the same malware as we found in Operation Manul, and sometimes used

the exact same emails as the emails sent to EFF’s ​Respublika
clients and their associates,
 
 
on the same dates. Additionally, analysis by GovCERT of other spearphishing emails
 
 
 
 
sent to Ablyazov’s family and associates in 2015 concludes that the malware uses the
 
 
kaliex.net domain and covertly installs Bandook. For this reason we believe both groups
 
 
are targets of Operation Manul.

JRat Malware Family 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

One of the common malware samples used over the course of Operation Manul is known
 
 
as JRat or Jacksbot. JRat is a commercially available remote access tool (RAT), written in
Java. JRat is currently available for purchase at jrat[.]io for the price of $40 USD.
JRat
 
has been continuously developed for the last four years, seemingly by a single developer
 
who goes by the name “redp0ison”. While JRat itself is closed source, many modules and
 
helpful utilities are open source and are available on github.  5

JRat is a cross platform RAT, able to target hosts running Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD,
 
 
and even Solaris. The RAT is highly modular—it even has an open API so that the
attacker may write custom modules to fit their needs. JRat modules include the following
 
functionality: keylogging, reverse proxy, password recovery, turning on the host webcam,
 
disabling webcam indicator light, listing host processes, opening a shell on the host,
 
editing the host registry, and even chatting with the remote host. JRat also provides a
   
controller application, which is written in Java. This controller application allows the
 
attacker to manage all of their JRat instances and view uptime, operating system, and
 
other information about all infected hosts. JRat also provides a web version of the
 
controller, which is open source.   6

researcher.

names, it also encodes the strings by xoring them with a series of random bytes, and
 
includes extraneous code-paths. All of this is done to make the java bytecode harder to
 
decompile and analyze for the reverse engineer.    
 
The JRat JAR file contains an encrypted config file named ​config.dat. ​The JRat
 
config file is encrypted using AES in CBC mode. The encryption key and IV are cleverly
 
hidden in the “extra” field for the zipped config.dat file. As illustrated in the example
 
below (Fig. 7), the extra field begins at offset ​0x30 ​of the file header for a given file in
 
 
 
the compressed JAR. Within the 32 byte ​extra ​field, the first 16 bytes are the AES
 
decryption key, and the last 16 bytes store the IV.

Once it is decrypted, we are able to extract the plaintext configuration information
 
 
including the domain of the command and control server and port number (Fig 8). JRat
also employs anti-virtualization features to detect and shut down if it is being run in
 
VirtualBox, VMware, or other virtualization software.  
 
JRat is low cost, versatile, extensible, and feature rich. Given these facts and the diversity
 
of systems that JRAT can infect it is perhaps not surprising that the attackers chose this
 
particular RAT.

Bandook Malware Family 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The other malware family used in this campaign is the commercially available RAT
 
known as “Bandook.” Bandook has been available since roughly 2007. This sample seems
 
 
to have been continuously developed and improved over the course of the last couple of
 
years. Unlike JRat, Bandook is only able to target Windows computers.

Core Functionality 
All Bandook executables are similar in size. Generally, they are masqueraded with fake
 
Flash Player, Office document, or PDF document icons. None of the Bandook samples we
 
have found in this campaign have been configured so as to execute an actual decoy
 
document. 
Normally, Bandook is distributed with an initial stub. This executable would contain
 
 
 
another PE32 binary as an embedded PE resource. Bandook makes use of a common
technique referred to as "process hollowing." It instantiates several suspended browser
 
processes and then replaces the loaded executable memory with the code contained in
 
the embedded resource previously mentioned.

Interestingly, this binary was uploaded on malwr.com in early June 2016 with the file
name "Form13.exe" (which might suggest a development version). Currently, the same
 
binary doesn't seem to be available in any other malware repository to which we have
 
access. In this case, the malware did not execute after having successfully identified a
   
virtualized environment, which might suggest the upload was potentially done by the
 
authors as an attempt to verify the evasion technique. 
 
It is also worth noting that while normally the embedded resource is obfuscated in
 
binaries distributed in the wild, this specific case is the only one we identified with the
 
 
resource embedded in the clear.

Network Indicators and Modularity 
After some initialization, Bandook performs an initial beacon with the general
 
 
information and configuration details it previously collected. Then it expects a command
 
in response from the Command & Control server. If idle, the C&C will reply with
 
"​@0000​", and the malware will keep beaconing back the title bar of the currently active
 
window, until it is instructed to do something else. 
 
Interestingly, the basic payload isn't provided with the code to perform any significant
 
 
action. If instructed to do so, Bandook will download additional DLL files which provide
the specifically desired functionality. This is probably meant to limit the exposure of the
 
core modules to analysts, and to vet the infection before performing a full deployment. 
 
In this case the available DLLs can have the names: 
 
cap.dll 
extra.dll 
pws.dll 
tv.dll 
Ammyy.dll 
 
We were able to obtain the first three DLLs, which were located at the URL
 
 
hxxp://axroot.com/plg10/.  
 
The following is a list of overall features available in this version of Bandook:

Given the common thread tying together the targets we find it likely that this campaign
 
was carried out by—or on the behalf of—the government of Kazakhstan, or forces allied
 
with the government. The majority of the targets of the malware campaign are currently
 
embroiled in legal disputes with the government of Kazakhstan in European courts or are
 
the family members or associates of people involved in these disputes. The titles of
 
 
 
spearphishing emails often indicate that the targets are being singled out specifically for
their interest in matters pertaining to Kazakhstan, such as “Information KZ,” “Press

Leaked emails published by Kazaword allege that the government of Kazakhstan had
 
previously hired a private intelligence company known as Arcanum to perform a
 
surveillance and data extraction mission (codenamed “Raptor) targeting Mr. Ablyazov
 
and his family. Among the services offered by Arcanum are “Full Spectrum Cyber

Emails published by Kazaword and analyzed by Mediapart allege that Arcanum
 
employed ​Bernard Squarcini, head of France’s domestic intelligence agency, the
 
Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur (DCRI) from 2007 to 2012, to inform the
 
Kazakh authorities of the progress of the legal proceedings against Ablyazov and to lobby
 
 
certain figures in France. Squarcini confirmed to Mediapart that the government of
Kazakhstan is a client, but Arcanum spokeswoman Yael Hartmann denied that the
 
company was responsible for the spearphishing attempts, insisting that the company has
 
 
complied with Swiss law. 
 
There is certainly some strong evidence consistent with there being a link between
 
 
Operation Manul and the government of Kazakhstan and between the government of
Kazakhstan and Arcanum. However, we observe no direct links between Operation
 
Manul and Arcanum. The technical evidence discussed below, we believe points instead
 
to an Indian company: Appin.

We examined the behavior of the command and control domains used by Operation
 
Manul as they moved from IP to IP. Using Passive Total, we observed that the C2
domains from Operational Manul used a total of 76 IPs from 2008-07-20 to 2016-05-11.
 
We must consider that these domains could have been used by other actors over this time
 
period.  
 
 
While considering attribution of the actors behind Operation Manul, we investigated the
possibility of infrastructure overlap with known actors. Gathering data from existing
 
APT reports we automated gathering of historical data from known APT domains from
 
the Passive Total API and comparison with the historical data from Operational Manul
 
domains.  
 
 
From this we were able to observe overlaps between Operation Manul and an actor
known as Appin. Appin is an Indian company that allegedly provides offensive

cyber-capability on a contract basis. A 2013 report by the cybersecurity firm Norman
 
10
Shark, titled “Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure” ,
describes multiple campaigns linked to this actor. The campaigns included attacks on
 
Punjabi separatists,Norwegian telecom Telenor,  and multiple other companies. 
 
Appin is an exceptionally noisy actor, which might be expected given the contract nature
 
of their work. Prior research revealed 607 domains related to Appin which we were able
 
 
to link via historical passive DNS to 1345 IPs. Of these, there were direct overlaps for
two of the Operational Manul domains. There were indirect overlaps (same IP, at
 
different times) with 110 of the Operation Hangover domains and all but two of the
 
domains associated with Operation Manul. 
 
The domains researchwork.org and dropboxonline.com were both on 64.202.189.170 on
 
 
2011-01-14. Additionally, the domains adobeair.net and bikefanclub.info both resided on
50.63.202.94 from 2014-04-24 to 2014-04-25. The researchwork.org and bikefanclub.org
 
domains were attributed to Appin in the Operation Hangover report, while adobeair.net
 
and dropboxonline.com were observed during the investigation of Operation Manul.
 
 
Additionally there was a near overlap between abobeair[.]net (one of the Operation
Manul domains) and appinsecurity[.]com (attributed to Appin in the Operation
 
Hangover report) both hosted at 174.120.120.151  just five days apart in August of 2010. 
 
What’s more, according to an appeal filed in a Swiss court on behalf of the Ablyazov
 
family, several of the malware samples sent to Mr. Ablyazov’s son-in-law and his attorney
 
and linked with this campaign were variants of the HackBack Trojan. This Trojan is in
 
the same malware family as the Trojan found on an Angolan activist’s computer at the
 
 
Oslo Freedom Forum in 2013—which was also linked to Appin by researchers at ESET
and Norman Security . We were unable to obtain the samples mentioned in the legal
 
documents at the time of this writing. 
 
 
A report written by the Swiss federal police, which investigated the origin of several of
the spearphishing emails sent to Ablyazov’s family and associates, concluded that the
 
emails were sent from IP addresses in India.

While there are links to Appin, it’s not conclusive that Operation Manul was carried out
 
 
by this actor. Both 50.63.202.94 and 64.202.189.170 are very busy domains. Passive Total
 
tells us that 50.63.202.94 has hosted 4535 unique domains since 2012, while 64.202.189.10
has hosted 4213 unique domains since 2009. Additionally, while the overlap with Appin
 
exists, the fact that domains used the same IP at the same time is insufficient for concrete
 
attribution. The evidence is consistent with links to Appin, but remains inconclusive.
 
Certainly, the sort of targeting we have seen in Operation Manul appears to be
 
consistent with other efforts targeting activists that have been associated with the same
 
actor.

Fig 10. Uploaded password files from other victims 
 
 
While investigating the C2 servers associated with Operation Manul, we discovered
several open directories which contained files presumably related to other operations
 
 
being run by this same actor (Fig 10). Additionally, we discovered web control panels for
several different commodity RATs located under directories that appeared to be
 
code-names for different operations (Fig 11). We also discovered several files which were
 
presumably uploaded from other victims’ computers (Fig 12). Lastly, we discovered
 
encrypted data dumps from yet more campaigns, which we were unable at the time of
 
 
this report. 
 
We found many related samples of the Bandook Trojan while we were doing our
 
example,

We also found several uploaded log files which indicate the presence of an Android
 
RAT. Unfortunately we were to find samples of this RAT at the time of this report. ​ 
 
The discoveries
 
that we made while investigating the command and control
 
infrastructure associated with this campaign suggest that these attackers are “hired guns”
 
and have multiple operations against different targets going on at the same time.

Operation Manul is not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that attacks
 
don’t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective. Not a single sample that we have
 
found in this campaign has employed a 0-day vulnerability. Unlike the lawful
 
interception software that companies such as FinFisher and Hacking Team sell to
 
governments and law enforcement, the RATs employed in this campaign are not only
 
commercially-available to anyone, they’re cheap.  
 
The fact that these attacks are not sophisticated should not discourage other researchers
 
 
from doing similar work. For activists and journalists who are being surveilled by
authoritarian governments, surveillance is often just the first step in a campaign of
 
intimidation, threats, and even direct violence. This kind of security research has the
 
potential to have a real impact on vulnerable people. We suspect that the use of malware
 
by governments to spy on political dissidents, especially exiles who live outside of their
 
government’s direct sphere of influence is increasingly common, which presents many
 
opportunities for further research. 
 
The possible connections between the government of Kazakhstan and companies that
 
provide “hackers for hire” suggest that the problem of governments using malware to spy
 
 
lawful
on political exiles and independent journalists goes beyond the sale of
 
 
interception software. We hope that further research will help to shed light on this
 
 
 
practice and the companies that make these services available.
