Recommended Reading about GRIZZLY STEPPE 

DHS recommends reading multiple bodies of work concerning GRIZZLY STEPPE. While DHS 
does not endorse any particular company or their findings, we believe the breadth of literature 
created by multiple sources enhances the overall understanding of the threat. DHS encourages 
analysts to review these resources to determine the level of threat posed to their local network 
environments. 

DHS Resources 

JAR-16-20296 provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the 
Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks 
and endpoints associated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. Government, political, 
and private sector entities. JAR-16-20296 remains a useful resource for understanding APT28 
and APT29 use of the cyber kill chain and exploit targets. Additionally, JAR-16-20296 discusses 
some of the differences in activity between APT28 and APT29. This AR primarily focuses on 
APT28 and APT29 activity from 2015 through 2016. 

DHS Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR)-10105049 UPDATE 2 was updated January 27, 
2017 to provide additional analysis of the artifacts identified in JAR 16-20296. The artifacts 
analyzed in this report include 17 PHP files, 3 executables and 1 RTF file. The PHP files are web 
shells designed to provide a remote user an interface for various remote operations. The RTF file 
is a malicious document designed to install and execute a malicious executable. However, DHS 
recommends that analysts read the MIFR in full to develop a better understanding of how the 
GRIZZLY STEPPE malware executes on a system, which, in turn, downloads additional 
malware and attempts to extract cached passwords. The remaining two executables are Remote 
Access Tools (RATs) that collect host information, including digital certificates and private keys, 
and provide an actor with remote access to the infected system. 

Open Source 

Several cyber security and threat research firms have written extensively about GRIZZLY 
STEPPE. DHS encourages network defenders, threat analysts, and general audiences to review 
publicly available information to develop a better understanding of the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of APT28 and APT29 and to potentially mitigate against GRIZZLY STEPPE 
activity.  

The below examples do not constitute an exhaustive list. The U.S. Government does not endorse 
or support any particular product or vendor.

Utilizing Cyber Kill Chain for Analysis 

DHS analysts leverage the Cyber Kill Chain model to analyze, discuss, and dissect malicious 
cyber activity. The phases of the Cyber Kill Chain are Reconnaissance, Weaponization, 
Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and Actions on the Objective. This 
section will provide a high-level overview of GRIZZLY STEPPE activity within this framework.  

Reconnaissance 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors use various reconnaissance methods to determine the best attack 
vector for compromising their targets. These methods include network vulnerability scanning, 
credential harvesting, and using “doppelganger” (also known as “typo-squatting”) domains to 
target victim organizations. The doppelganger domains can be used for reconnaissance when 
users incorrectly type in the web address in a browser or as part of delivery as a URL in the body 
of a phishing emails. DHS recommends that network defenders review and monitor their 
networks for traffic to sites that look similar to their own domains. This can be an indicator of 
compromise that should trigger further research to determine whether a breach has occurred. 
Often, these doppelganger sites are registered to suspicious IP addresses. For example, a site 
pretending to be an organization’s User Log In resolving to a TOR node IP address may be 
considered suspicious and should be researched by the organization’s security operations center 
(SOC) for signs of users navigating to that site. Because these doppelganger sites normally 
mimic the targeted victim’s domain, they were not included in JAR-16-20296.  

Before the 2016 U.S. election, DHS observed network scanning activity that is known as 
reconnaissance. The IPs identified performed vulnerability scans attempting to identify websites 
that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or Structured Query Language (SQL) injection 
attacks. When GRIZZLY STEPPE actors identify a vulnerable site, they can then attempt to 
exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the targeted network. Network perimeter 
scans are often a precursor to network attacks and DHS recommends that security analysts 
identify the types of scans carried out against their perimeters. This information can aid security 
analysts in identifying and patching vulnerabilities in their systems. 

Another common method used by GRIZZLY STEPPE is to host credential-harvesting pages as 
seen in Step 4 and Step 5 of the GRIZZLY STEPPE attack lifecycle graphic. This technique 
includes hosting a temporary website in publicly available infrastructure (i.e., neutral space) that 
users are directed to via spear-phishing emails. Users are tricked into entering their credentials in 
these temporary sites, and GRIZZLY STEPPE actors gain legitimate credentials for users on the 
targeted network.

Weaponization 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have excelled at embedding malicious code into a number of file 
types as part of their weaponization efforts. In 2014, it was reported that GRIZZLY STEPPE 
actors were wrapping legitimate executable files with malware (named “OnionDuke”) to 
increase the chance of bypassing security controls. Since weaponization actions occur within the 
adversary space, there is little that can be detected by security analysts during this phase. APT28 
and APT29 weaponization methods have included: 

  Code injects in websites as watering hole attacks 
  Malicious macros in Microsoft Office files 
  Malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) files with embedded malicious flash code 

 

Delivery 

As described in JAR-16-20296 and numerous publicly available resources, GRIZZLY STEPPE 
actors traditionally use spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious attachments or URLs that lead 
to malicious payloads. DHS recommends that network defenders conduct analysis of their 
systems to identify potentially malicious emails involving variations on GRIZZLY STEPPE 
themes. Inbound emails subjects should be reviewed for the following commonly employed 
titles, text, and themes: 

Invites for cyber threat events 

  efax, e-Fax, efax #100345 (random sequence of numbers) 
  PDF, PFD, Secure PDF 
  Topics from current events (e.g., “European Parliament statement on…”) 
  Fake Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) log-in emails 
 
 
Additionally, GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have infected pirated software in torrent services and 
leveraged TOR exit nodes to deliver to malware since at least 2014. These actors are capable of 
compromising legitimate domains and services to host and deliver malware in an attempt to 
obscure their delivery methods. DHS notes that the majority of TOR traffic is not GRIZZLY 
STEPPE activity. The existence of a TOR IP in a network log only indicates that network 
administrators should review the related traffic to determine if it is legitimate activity for that 
specific environment.  
 
Exploitation 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have developed malware to exploit a number of Common 
Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs). DHS assesses that these actors commonly target Microsoft 
Office exploits due to the high likelihood of having this software installed on the targeted hosts.

While not all-encompassing, the following CVEs have been targeted by GRIZZLY STEPPE 
actors in past attacks.  

  CVE-2016-7855: Adobe Flash Player Use-After-Free Vulnerability 
  CVE-2016-7255: Microsoft Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability 
  CVE-2016-4117: Adobe Flash Player Remoted Attack Vulnerability 
  CVE-2015-1641: Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability 
  CVE-2015-2424: Microsoft PowerPoint Memory Corruption Vulnerability 
  CVE-2014-1761: Microsoft Office Denial of Service (Memory Corruption)  
  CVE-2013-2729: Integer Overflow in Adobe Reader and Acrobat vulnerability 
  CVE-2012-0158: ActiveX Corruption Vulnerability for Microsoft Office  
  CVE-2010-3333: RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability for Microsoft Office  
  CVE-2009-3129: Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Remote Attacks  

 

Installation 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have leveraged several different types of implants in the past. 
Analysts can research these implants by reviewing open-source reporting on malware families 
including Sofacy, and Onion Duke. Recently, DHS analyzed 17 PHP files, 3 executables, and 1 
RTF file attributed to GRIZZLY STEPPE actors and the findings are located in MIFR-
10105049-Update2 (updated on 1/26/2017). The PHP files are web shells designed to provide a 
user interface for various remote operations. The RTF file is a malicious document designed to 
install and execute a malicious executable. DHS recommends that security analysts review their 
systems for unauthorized web shells.  

Command and Control 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors leverage their installed malware through Command and Control (C2) 
infrastructure, which they traditionally develop via compromised sites and publicly available 
infrastructure, such as TOR. C2 IOCs are traditionally the IP addresses or domains that are 
leveraged to send and receive commands to and from malware implants.  

Actions on the Objective 

GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have leveraged their malware in multiple campaigns with various end 
goals. GRIZZLY STEPPE actors are capable of utilizing their malware to conduct extensive data 
exfiltration of sensitive files, emails, and user credentials. Security operation center (SOC) 
analysts may be able to detect actions on the objective before data exfiltration occurs by looking 
for signs of files and user credential movement within their network.

APPENDIX C: Mitigations Guidance 

Defending Against Webshell Attacks 

Defend 
  Continually patch all webservers and all web components servicing the site, including PHP, 

Apache, IIS, and ColdFusion. Deploying a webshell typically requires adding to, or 
modifying, the code presented by the web server and is often accomplished via an exploit of 
a web server vulnerability. Patching all components that service the web server provides a 
substantial mitigation against most commonly known vulnerabilities. 

  Adhere to least privilege principles for server access and management. Through following 

the principle of least privilege, lateral movement and privilege escalation is made more 
challenging to an attacker by restricting access on the box and across the network. 

  Restrict write access to all folders that contain files served by the web server. All content 

served by the web server should be tightly controlled in such a way that only web 
administrator accounts can modify or add content. This would force an attacker to gain 
specific sets of credentials before they could add any malicious content to be delivered by the 
server. 

  Restrict access to all ports and administrative panels. Server ports are typically very 

predictable, and access to those ports should be constrained to only the services and users 
that require them. This will reduce the attack surface on the web server and supporting 
applications. 

  Deploy and configure Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) on supported Linux specific 

systems. SELinux has the capability to lock down web services such as Apache and can be 
configured to allow the service to access only certain directories. The administrators could 
possibly include /var/www/html, which contains the actual pages being served up. If a site 
has upload capabilities, then SELinux could help with least privilege by restricting read/write 
access on these folders as well. The web service already runs in a lower privilege context, but 
SELinux would also limit the file locations that it can actually access. This would prevent 
arbitrary file writes and possible malware uploads to areas that an admin would not normally 
detect. 

  Conduct regular vulnerability scans and establish a remediation strategy focusing on the most 

detrimental findings first. Regular scanning and remediation measures will remove 
opportunities to exploit known attack vectors by an adversary. 

  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF). WAF technologies defend against common web 

exploitation techniques such as SQL injection and cross site scripting. Deploying this 
capability helps reduce the likelihood of a successful web attack on the server that could 
otherwise allow the perpetrator to modify code and deploy the webshell.

  Where third party products are integrated into the website (e.g., Adobe ColdFusion) ensure 

that the product is configured according to DoD or vendor published hardening best 
practices.1 

Detect 
  Conduct regular log review. Key sources should include the network and host firewalls, 

Intrusion Prevention System, proxy, and local event logs. Events of interest should include 
high usage rates to suspicious IPs, odd timestamps on web files (dates that don’t match 
previous content updates), odd connections destined for internal networks, suspicious files in 
internet accessible locations, references to key words such as cmd.exe or eval.4 Auditing 
should involve some kind of aggregator to store and secure the logs remotely. Even the best 
auditing on the web server is useless if the attacker can just manipulate or delete them once 
they have obtained control. The logs should be protected and regularly rolled up to a 
centralized location for integration into a security information and event management system. 

  Develop all content in an offline environment and maintain a hash list of all web files. 

Frequently compare the hashes of the files on the web server to the known good list 
maintained offline (an automated method is preferred). 

  Obtain regular full system backups (including snapshots if it is a virtual machine). 

Forensically the known good data that these can provide is extremely useful for detection. 
Having a copy of the filesystem before a compromise to compare against the post-
compromise filesystem can be a benefit to any analysis.  

  Analyze traffic flows looking for certain anomalous behaviors such as prolonged 

connections, data frequently being pushed to the server (e.g., commands being sent to the 
shell), frequent large data transfers (an indication of data exfiltration), and abnormal 
encryption (anything that is not SSL/TLS or that negotiates using an alternate certificate) as 
indicators of potential nefarious activity.2  

Contain 
 

Internet facing web servers should be deployed to a DMZ. All traffic to internal networks 
from the DMZ should be significantly constrained and highly monitored. 

  Restrict outbound communications from the DMZ to all other networks. Communications 

originating in the DMZ destined for the internal network should be minimal at most (ideally 
this should never happen). An attacker who gains access to a web server in the DMZ should 
have no capability to leverage that access in order to gain direct additional access in the 
internal network. Web server communications to the internet should be restricted to http/https 
only. All other ports and protocols should be blocked.

  When a Domain Controller (DC) is necessary in the DMZ, it is recommended that a 

standalone DC and forest structure be deployed. Additionally, all accounts and resources in 
the DMZ instance should have no association or likeness to the internal network.  

  Ensure separation of admin accounts. The web admin account should not be the same admin 

account that is used elsewhere on the domain.  

Respond 
  When a compromise is found, reset all credentials associated with the webserver (this may 

expand to all accounts in the DMZ if it is suspected that the compromise has expanded to the 
DC). This should include all user and service accounts, all domain accounts that have logged 
onto that host and all local accounts, to include the Kerberos master ticket granting ticket on 
the DC. Depending on the circumstances, it may also be necessary to take the suspected 
server(s) or network offline during the remediation process. 

  All server files should be wiped and restored from a known good source. The organization 

should prepare for a disaster recovery situation that includes a system compromise. Regular 
backups and offline storage of the data files should be made before being transferred to the 
DMZ production environment. 

  When all other response techniques have failed at remediating the suspected compromise, the 
server(s) should be completely rebuilt or replaced. All data reconstitution efforts should stem 
from a known good source (offline backup).  
 

Defending Against Spear Phishing Attacks 

Defend 
  Enforce application whitelisting on all endpoint workstations to prevent droppers or 

unauthorized software from gaining execution on endpoints. Many phishing attacks involve 
an executable that is dropped and installed on the victim’s machine. Application Whitelisting 
will allow the organization to monitor programs and allow only those that are on the 
approved whitelist to execute. This would help to stop the initial attack, even if the user has 
clicked the link or opened a malicious attachment. There are many baseline rulesets that 
come with the vendor product, but the organization should ensure that at least the user Temp 
directories are blocked for execution since this is where numerous phishing emails attempt to 
drop and execute malware. 

  Disable Macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through 
an attached office document. Macros were often used as a means for initial exploitation in the 
late 1990s and early 2000s but have seen a recent resurgence in frequency of use. Some 
office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the 
organization and can provide a hybrid approach when the organization depends on the 
legitimate use of macros. For Windows, specific settings can be configured to block Internet 
originated macros from running. This can be done in the Group Policy Administrative 
Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint). For example, to enable the policy setting for Microsoft Word 2016, in the

Group Policy Management Editor, select: User Configuration > Administrative Templates 
> Microsoft Word 2016 > Word Options > Security > Trust Center > Block macros 
from running in Office files from the Internet3 

  Utilize up to date web browsers on the network for increased security enhancements. These 

improvements may include a sandboxing feature that would allow the browser to contain any 
malicious content and protect the endpoint if an emailed link is clicked. 

  Deploy web and email filters on the network and configure these devices to scan for known 

bad domains, sources, and addresses; block these before messages are received and 
downloaded. This action will help to reduce the attack surface at the network’s first level of 
defense. In addition, attachments should be filtered. The network defenses should only allow 
approved extensions to pass through to the email client. Most .exe, scripting extensions 
(including .bat, .js, and .ps1) and other executable extensions should be blocked. 

  Scan all emails, attachments, and downloads both on host and at the mail gateway with a 
reputable antivirus solution that includes cloud reputation services. Taking advantage of 
cloud reputation advancements provides rapid response capabilities and the integration of a 
broad base of cyber defense intelligence.  

  Organizations should ensure that they have disabled HTML from being used in emails, as 

well as disabling links. Everything should be forced to plain text. This will reduce the 
likelihood of potentially dangerous scripts or links being sent in the body of the email, and 
also will reduce the likelihood of a user just clicking something without thinking about it. 
With plain text, the user would have to go through the process of either typing in the link or 
copying and pasting. This additional step will allow the user an extra opportunity for thought 
and analysis before clicking on the link. 

  Establish a training mechanism to inform end users on proper email and web usage as well as 
common indicators of phishing to be aware of. This training should be done at least annually 
and should include a test that is scored and available for viewing by management and/or the 
IT Security department. The training should inform users what suspicious emails look like, 
what to do when they suspect phishing, as well as explain what they should post on any 
websites in terms of personally identifiable information (PII) that may be used for phishing 
campaigns (including email addresses, job titles, names, etc.). Consider real life interactive 
training simulations where users are sent suspicious emails on a semi regular basis and 
subsequently redirected to a phishing training site should they fail to adhere to the 
organization’s best practices and policies. 

Detect 
  Monitor event logs, email logs, and firewall logs for any indicators of a potential attack. 

These could include emails from suspicious domains, installation of programs on machines

that are unusual or not approved, unusual call outs to the internet from office products, non-
smtp traffic from the email client, strange child processes under the parent office process, or 
spoofed domains sending or receiving traffic from the network. Strange Traffic/Behavior 
(e.g., Spamming others) should also be looked for in the various logs. This is a strong 
indicator that machine(s) are compromised in some way. 

  Using the antivirus software that is installed on the mailbox server and all of the clients, 

review the alerts and logs regularly for any activity on the network. The sooner detection can 
take place, the sooner remediation steps can start, and the amount of damage can be 
minimalized.  

  Users play an important role in the detection of spear phishing if they understand the proper 

reporting procedures of the organization. Users should be able to identify the correct 
handling and alerting procedure that the users should follow for any suspicious email they 
receive. 

  Using the logs from the organizations firewalls/filters/security devices/workstations, 

administrators should always ensure that their whitelisted and blacklisted domains are up to 
date. Admins should also check DoD blacklists for known bad domains and add these to their 
filters as well. Using these logs and lists, the organization may benefit from other incidents 
that have occurred to help in the future 

Contain 
  Utilize application containment products that can be used to prevent the downloading and 

propagation of malicious software on the network. If the organization is using some form of 
web email, the browser must be containerized. If the organization is using a program for 
email (e.g., Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird), then that program should be 
containerized for protection. The Application Containment will open the browser or email 
program in its own Virtual Machine and isolate it from the rest of the system. This allows the 
execution of potential malware in a sandboxed environment so the host system is protected. 

 

Implement front and back end email servers when running on site instantiations of mail 
services. Having a front-end server allows the organization to have an extra layer of 
protection on the network since the front-end mailbox server contains no user data and allows 
a firewall to be placed before the back end server. This is also safer and more convenient for 
any web accessed email since web traffic is not being allowed directly into the network, 
protects from denial-of-service attacks, and authenticates requests before proxying them to 
the back end server.4 

  Control where and when an administrator can log on, as well as what they can do when 

logged onto a system. This can minimize the damage of a spear phishing attack. Admins 
should never be allowed to browse the internet, nor should they be allowed to open any email 
program. This will reduce the likelihood of an accidental click or download of a program that 
could be malicious. This also will reduce the chances that a successful attacker will gain

admin privileges immediately when they gain access to the system. Organizations can 
accomplish this restriction a number of ways, including application whitelisting, VLAN 
separation, dedicated administrator boxes, etc. 

  Ensure that standard user accounts are not a part of the local administrators group. The local 

administrator account should also be denied network access and all built in local 
administrator accounts should have a unique password value. It is a common tactic to look 
for local administrator credentials as a method of expanding access across the network. 
Making these values unique for each machine and denying that account network access 
removes the attacker’s capability to easily expand access using the same credentials5.  

Respond 
 

If a phishing email is discovered or suspected, the organization needs to start their normal 
investigation procedures. It may be as simple as deleting that email and updating the email 
filter to prevent this address/domain from sending to the organization again, but it could also 
trigger a normal incident response. If the email contained a link that was clicked, an 
attachment that was downloaded, or a program that was executed, the organization may have 
to remove any malicious content, discover the extent of the possible spread, detail any 
exfiltration of data, or even remove the affected machine(s) or rebuild them. 

  Reset user credentials and all credentials associated with all compromised boxes. This should 

include services accounts and machine accounts as well as the supporting Kerberos tickets.  

  Monitor all accounts associated with the spear-phishing event. User accounts who are 

suspected to have been the victim of a successful phishing campaign should be forensically 
monitored for abnormal behaviors including unusual connections to non-standard resources, 
attempts to elevate privileges, enumeration behaviors on the local host machine as well as 
remote systems, and attempts to execute odd programs or applications.

Description
This file is a malicious PHP file containing an embedded obfuscated payload. This payload is Base64 encoded and password protected. 
During runtime, this payload will be decoded and decrypted using combination of a base64_decode and a password. 

Analysis indicates that the web-shell will be accessed and executed through a browser by a remote user. The file will prompt the user to 
enter a password. The password entered is submitted via $_POST and stored in a cookie at runtime.

The password "root" was used to decrypt the payload. The decrypted payload contains a PHP web-shell and has been identified as P.A.S. 
v.3.1.0. This web-shell is a backdoor that provides an interface (see Screenshot) for various remote operations, such as file explorer, 
searcher, SQL-client, network tools, command shell access, and server info features to a remote user once installed on the compromised 
system. The following are some of the P.A.S webshell capabilities: 

--Begin Capabilities-- 
To view compromised server information. 
File manager (copy, rename, move, download, upload, delete, jump, create files and folders). 
Search files, objects, directories, and text in files. 
SQL client to login and dump database and tables. 

US-CERT MIFR-10105049-Update2

3 of 63

Network console to bindport, back-connect, and port scanner. 
Command line console to execute command. 
Execute PHP code. 
--End Capabilities-- 

The webshell P.A.S. v.3.1.0 interface is shown in image 1.0.

Description
This is a malicious PHP file containing an embedded obfuscated payload. This payload is Base64 encoded and password protected. During 
runtime, this payload will be decoded and decrypted using combination of a base64_decode and a password. This password is submitted via 
a POST request or in a cookie at runtime. The following password "|F3Jk~6k6" was used to decrypt the payload. The decrypted payload 
contains a PHP webshell and has been identified as P.A.S. v.3.1.0. This webshell is a backdoor that provides an interface for various remote 
operations, such as file explorer, searcher, SQL-client, network tools, command shell access, and server info features to a remote user once 
installed on the compromised system. The following are some of the P.A.S webshell capabilities:
--Begin Capabilities--
To view compromised server information.
File manager (copy, rename, move, download, upload, delete, jump, create files and folders).
Search files, objects, directories, and text in files.
SQL client to login and dump database and tables.
Network console to bindport, back-connect, and port scanner.
Command line console to execute command.
Execute PHP code.
--End Capabilities--
The webshell interface is shown in image 1.0.

Analysis indicates this application provides several notable capabilities to an operator. The program provides an operator access to a 
reverse shell on the victim system. Additionally, the malware provides an operator the capability to enumerate the victims Windows 
Certificate Store, and extract identified digital certificates, including private keys. The application also allows an operator to enumerate all 
physical drives and network resources the victim system has access to.

Description
This is a malicious RTF document containing an embedded encoded executable. Upon execution, the RTF will decode and install the 
executable to %Temp%\m3.tmp (9f918fb741e951a10e68ce6874b839aef5a26d60486db31e509f8dcaa13acec5).  The encoded executable is 
decoded using a hexadecimal algorithm. The document will attempt to execute m3.tmp but fails to execute due to the file exetension.

Static analysis of the unpacked portions of this file indicate it is, among other things, capable of targeting multiple Windows applications. For 
example, the malware searches the Windows registry for keys utilized by multiple types of Windows email software. If found, the malware 
attempts to extract email passwords from these keys. This appears to be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the victim users emails. 

In addition, the software attempts to find registry keys used by the Windows file management software named Total Commander. This 
appears to be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the victim users stored files. The software also contains a list of commonly used 
passwords. This indicates the malware provides an operator the capability to brute force their way into a victim users email accounts or 
locations where their files are stored. Displayed below is a YARA signature which may be utilized to detect this software both packed on disk, 
and running within system memory.

US-CERT would like to remind users and administrators of the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their 
organization's systems:

Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the
file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats; implement appropriate ACLs.
