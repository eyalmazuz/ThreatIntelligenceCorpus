Executive Summary

Operation Groundbait (Russian: Прикормка, Prikormka) is an ongoing cyber-surveil-
lance operation targeting individuals in Ukraine. The group behind this operation 
has been launching targeted and possibly politically-motivated attacks to spy on 
individuals.

This paper presents ESET’s findings about Operation Groundbait based on our re-
search into the Prikormka malware family. This includes detailed technical analysis 
of the Prikormka malware family and its spreading mechanisms, and a description 
of the most noteworthy attack campaigns.

Key findings:

•  The country where the malware has been seen most is Ukraine.  

It has been active since at least 2008.

•  The primary targets of Operation Groundbait are anti-government 

separatists in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's 
Republics in Eastern Ukraine.

•  There have also been a large number of other targets, including 
Ukrainian government officials, Ukrainian politicians, Ukrainian 
journalists and others.

•  The attackers most likely operate from within Ukraine.

The discovery

In the third quarter of 2015 ESET identified a previously unknown modular mal-
ware family, Prikormka. Further research revealed that this malware has been 
active since at least 2008 and the country where the malware has been seen most 
is Ukraine. The reason why it had gone unnoticed for so long is the relatively low 
infection ratio before 2015. The number of infections surged significantly in 2015.

178

One of the first examples of this malware that we analyzed in our laboratory had 
the name prikormka.exe. The Russian and Ukrainian word prikormka (Прикормка) 
means groundbait, a type of fish bait that is cast into the water to attract fish. We 
used this codename during our research and afterward we decided to keep it, so the 
malware has the names Win32/Prikormka and Win64/Prikormka respectively.

The low detection ratio and ability to stay undetected for years is a common char-
acteristic of targeted attacks (APTs).  The investigation of campaigns and Priko-
rmka activity has increased our confidence that this malware is used in targeted 
attacks. 

Targeted attacks are generally carried out for various purposes, including recon-
naissance, intellectual property theft, sabotage, and espionage. After analyzing 
tactics, techniques and procedures employed by this particular malware group, 
we came to the conclusion that individuals are targeted rather than companies. 
Even when the Prikormka malware was detected in a corporate environment, we 
never saw any lateral movement — a technique used by advanced adversaries in 
cyber-attacks.

We suspect that this group operates in Ukraine, where most of the victims are 
located. For that reason and due to the nature of these attacks, we classified them 
as cyber-surveillance operations.

The campaigns

In this section, we will show the most noteworthy and prominent campaigns and 
the decoy documents with which they are associated. 

Let’s examine detection statistics by country based on our ESET LiveGrid® statistics:

Belgium  2%

Russia 

13%

Ukraine  86%

Tajikistan 

1%

Russia 

12%

Ukraine  87%

Figure 2. Detection statistics for Prikormka malware according to ESET LiveGrid®.

According to our telemetry, Ukraine is the country with the majority of detections 
of this malware. In addition, our research revealed that the attackers behind this 
malware demonstrate native fluency of the Ukrainian and Russian languages and 
comprehensive understanding of the current political situation in Ukraine.

To answer the question of what kind of victims were attacked in the above-listed 
countries, we have analyzed the decoy documents used to target them.

The main infection vector that we identified during our research consists of spear- 
phishing emails with attached malicious executables or with a download link to 
a malicious file hosted on a remote server. When the user clicks on a malicious 
attachment that is masquerading as a document, the Prikormka dropper displays a 
decoy document in order to trick victims and distract their attention, since victims 
normally expect to see a document open when they click on an attachment. This 
technique works against less tech-savvy computer users; infection success, how-
ever, depends on the quality of spearphishing emails. The attacker has a greater 
chance to infect the computer when spearphishing letters and decoy documents 
are relevant to the victim — in other words, when the victim would not be sur-
prised to receive such a message from someone. Thus, analyzing such decoy docu-
ments can reveal information about the intended targets of these cyber-attacks.

Secondly, there is another artefact embedded in each sample of Prikormka mal-
ware, that we call the Campaign ID. These Campaign IDs are unique text strings 
used to identify specific infections or attempts at infection by the Prikormka 
malware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes 
reveal information about the intended targets. 

So far we have identified more than 80 different Campaign IDs and even more 
decoy documents linked to these IDs.  It was observed that usually one Campaign 
ID is used against one target, which can be an individual, some entity, or group 
of people. This means that one particular ID might be discovered on multiple 
computers.

A more comprehensive listing of representative campaigns, along with their com-
pilation timestamps and unique Campaign IDs is in Appendix A.

It is worth mentioning that in some cases it is hard to identify intended victims, 
especially when the Prikormka malware infections were discovered at the stage 
when the malware was already installed and active. However, we have become 
aware of some active Prikormka infections on computer networks belonging to 
high-value targets, including the Ukrainian government. Other noteworthy tar-
gets are mentioned in the following descriptions of Groundbait campaigns.

Campaigns against separatists

Among Prikormka's primary targets are separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Since 2014 
this region has been involved in an armed military conflict.

In April 2014 a group of people unilaterally proclaimed independence in two 
regions of Eastern Ukraine: Donetsk and Luhansk. In response, the Ukrainian 
government classified these two entities as terrorist organizations and, therefore, 
the territory of these regions was declared an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) zone. 
In May 11th 2014, the authorities of these self-proclaimed republics held  
a referendum seeking to legitimize the establishment of the republics.

A significant number of decoy documents that were used in Prikormka attacks ex-
ploited various topics related to the self-proclaimed states of the Donetsk People’s 
Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). Moreover, a number of 
decoy documents contain private data including internal statistics and documents 
apparently used in the internal workflow of these self-proclaimed states. This 
fact leads us to believe that operators are intentionally targeting people located 
in these two regions. These assumptions are confirmed by our ESET LiveGrid® 
telemetry: the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the two most infected regions 
in Ukraine by the Prikormka malware.

The attackers use social engineering tricks to convince a victim to open a mali-
cious attachment. These tricks include giving provocative or attractive names to 
the email attachments. Here are few examples of such filenames:

•  Нацгвардейцы со шприцами сделали из донецкого 

мальчика мишень для ракет.exe (From the Russian: National 
Guard of Ukraine aimed rockets at boy from Donetsk). Compilation 
timestamp: November 5th 2014 

•  Последнее обращение командира бригады 'Призрак' 

Мозгового Алексея Борисовича к солдатам и офицерам ДНР 
и ЛНР.scr  (From the Russian: Leader of the Prizrak Brigade Aleksey 
Borisovich Mozgovoy's last appeal to soldiers and officer of Donetsk 

People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic). Compilation 
timestamp: May 24th 2015

•  Места дислокации ВСУ в зоне проведения АТО.scr   

(From the Russian: Dislocation of the armed forces of Ukraine 
in ATO zone). Compilation timestamp: December 15th 2015

Here are examples of decoy documents that were used in attacks against  
separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk regions. 

•  The first example is an executable with the filename СПРАВОЧНИК 

по МИНИСТЕРСТВАМ обновленный.exe (From the Russian: 
Ministries directory – updated) that drops a decoy document with a 
list of Ministries of the self-proclaimed republic. The Campaign ID for 
this executable is D _ xxx. (Figure 3)

•  Here is another example of a decoy document, which was 

dropped by an executable named материалы к зачету по 
законодательству.exe (From the Russian: Materials for the law 
exam). This executable drops several documents including the LPR 
temporary constitution and other legal and political documents. 
The Campaign ID is L _ ment; the word “ment” is Russian slang for a 
policeman. Thus, the attackers demonstrate intimate knowledge of 
the Russian language. (Figure 4)

•  Some of the decoy documents use the Minsk agreement topic. Here 
is an example of one such document, which comes from a dropper 
with the filename Схема демилитаризованной зоны в районе 
Шиокино.exe (From the Russian: Scheme of the demilitarized zone 
in the Shyrokyne (Shyrokyne written with a typo in Russian)). The 
Campaign ID was Lminfin. (Figure 5)

•  Another decoy document even contains a map of the buffer zone 

established by the Minsk Protocol. Here is an example, which came 
from a dropper with the filename Отвод с 4 участками по 
сост на 14.08.exe (From the Russian: Pullout [of heavy weapons] 
on 14.08). The Campaign ID was BUR. (Figure 6)

Important note: Most of the Prikormka binaries that seem to have been intended 
for use against separatists have Campaign IDs starting with D or L characters. It's 
possible that this means Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Repub-
lic, respectively.  Also, we observed an executable named Заявление Эдуарда 
Басаргина 13 октября 2015 года в 15 часов.exe (From the Russian: Edu-
ard Basargin's statement on 13th October  2015 at 3pm), which uses the Campaign 
ID RF _ lgm. Since we have identified detections in Russia, the RF prefix could 
mean Russian Federation.

Campaign against Ukrainian nationalist political party

All previously mentioned decoy documents were extracted from executables that had 
Russian filenames. Ukrainian is the official state language; however, people in Eastern 
Ukraine tend to use Russian, as opposed to Western regions, which use Ukrainian. 

Some of the Prikormka binaries had names in Ukrainian. For example, we have seen 
the filename План ДНР на 21 липня, щодо відводу військ.exe (From the 
Ukrainian: The DPR plan for withdrawal of troops on 21st July).  Names of attach-
ments in the Ukrainian language might suggest that the receiver of such malicious 
letters prefer to speak Ukrainian over Russian. The fact that Prikormka malware 
was detected in Western regions of Ukraine strengthens this assumption. The 
Campaign ID for this particular executable was Psek, which inclines us to believe 
with a high degree of confidence that members of Ukrainian nationalist party 
Right Sector (Ukrainian: Pravyi Sektor) were targeted with Prikormka malware.

Other campaigns

Separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and the other targeted high profile victims 
weren’t the only targets of Operation Groundbait. We have observed some other 
campaigns with interesting decoy documents, but we can't identify the intended 
victims solely on the basis of those documents. 

Here is an example of a decoy document which was possibly used against a re-
ligious institute. The decoy document comes from dropper with filename Новое 
слово жизни.exe (From the Russian: New word of life). The Campaign ID was 
medium. This choice of Campaign ID may refer to mediumship and spiritualism.

Another campaign was discovered in March 2016. This time, the name of the 
malicious file was in Hungarian: Önéletrajz fizikai munka 2.pdf.scr, which 
translates to English as “CV physical work”. The decoy document dropped by this 
file was a person's CV (curriculum vitae or resume), written in Hungarian. This 
malicious .SCR file was sent compressed in single archive with two other docu-
ments: the CV of the same person in Ukrainian, and a certificate in Hungarian that 
confirms that this person is able to perform the physical job. Based on this infor-
mation it is hard to say who might be the intended target, but the fact its recip-
ient possibly knows Hungarian and Ukrainian makes this campaign interesting. 
The Campaign ID was F _ ego. 

Figure 8. Decoy document possibly used against religious organizations.

Figure 9. The Hungarian document that was sent to the victim in a single archive  

with the Prikormka malware.

Here is an example of a decoy document, dropped from a file with the name  
bitcoin.exe. The Campaign ID in this case was hmod.

Figure 10. Decoy document that explains how to commit credit card fraud.

The Russian text in the decoy document explains, step by step, how to buy bitcoins 
using stolen credit cards. The text abounds in slang words often used by Rus-
sian-speaking carders. ¹

Another example is a mysterious decoy document extracted from a malware 
dropper with the name prikormka.exe. The Campaign ID is 30K _ alfa.

This decoy document contains the pricelist of a Ukrainian shop that sells various 
types of groundbait.

Technical details

In this section, we will describe technical aspects of Prikormka malware, including 
malware architecture, C&C communication and detailed analysis of modules used.

Figure 12. Simplified scheme of the Prikormka malware's architecture.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

The dropper

The dropper is the initial component of this malware, which is usually sent through 
email as an attachment. Usually the dropper has a .SCR or .EXE file extension and 
is compressed into an archive. In order to trick the victim, the Prikormka dropper 
can masquerade as various types of document or self-extracting archive.

The SFX executable can contain one or more decoy documents. For example one 
SFX that was dropped by Prikormka contained 24 documents. Of course, the num-
ber and size of the decoy documents affects the size of the droppers. The biggest 
dropper we identified had a file size of 25MB.

Most of the dropper executables have an embedded application manifest, which 
specifies that the executable requires administrator privileges in order to run on 
the system. If the user does not have administrator privileges, the system will 
prompt for credentials. 

 Figure 13. Icons used by Prikormka malware.

Figure 15. The embedded application manifest embedded in Prikormka dropper.

When executed, the dropper infects the computer, but also displays one or more 
decoy documents. To this end, the malware displays a WinRAR self-extraction 
(SFX) archive window. In some cases, the dropper creates a legitimate, non-mali-
cious SFX executable on disk and then launches it. Interestingly, that SFX archive 
always has a Russian localized graphic user interface, even in cases where the file-
name of the dropper is in Ukrainian. The dropper which has a Hungarian filename 
does not display this window at all.

Figure 14. The Russian interface of SFX archive.

The dropper needs administrator privileges because of the technique used by the 
malware to become persistent on the infected system. Specifically, the malware 
uses so-called DLL load-order hijacking in order to start automatically on every 
system boot. The dropper saves one of the Prikormka DLL modules to the Win-
dows-directory under the name ntshrui.dll. Because this DLL file is stored in 
the Windows directory, it will be loaded on system boot by the explorer.exe 
process instead of the legitimate ntshrui.dll file, which is stored in the  
C:\Windows\System32 subdirectory. Thus, the Prikormka module hijacks the  
order of loading DLL files. This persistency method is not something new; it has 
been publicly examined multiple times by anti-malware research community.

Another interesting technique is used by the Prikormka malware, specifically by 
droppers with .SCR file extensions. The .SCR file extension stands for screensaver 
and represents a standard Windows executable file. The main difference between 
.EXE and .SCR is that a screensaver is executed with special command line argu-
ments. Usually, cybercriminals just rename an executable with the .SCR extension 
in order to bypass various security measures based on file extension. Prikormka's 
authors implemented a check for such command line arguments, so when the 

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit 

13

binary is executed as a standard executable (without the required arguments), 
it won’t infect the system. Thus, this simple check allowed the malware to bypass 
some sandboxes used for automatic sample processing.

In the case where the infection starts from a .SCR file, the Trojan uses standard 
methods for loading its DLL via rundll32.exe and for maintaining persistence, by 
setting an entry with the name guidVGA or guidVSA in the registry Run key:

[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]

In order to be loaded by the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of Windows Explorer the 
malware has binaries for both platforms. Most modules are written in the C pro-
gramming language and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio. 

The dropper stores modules in its resources; some of these resources are encrypt-
ed with a simple XOR operation.

Earlier versions of Prikormka used a different technique – Campaign IDs were 
embedded in the binary file of one of modules:

Figure 17. The Campaign ID with value hmyr32 is embedded in the binary.

The Campaign ID value was hardcoded in the Prikormka binary at compilation 
time; moreover, the ID in the 32-bit version of binaries ended with 2, while the 
Campaign ID in 64-bit version of binaries ended with 4.

This technique was probably efficient for a small number of victims, but it presum-
ably created problems for the attackers once the number of victims grew.  Perhaps 
recompiling and repacking the core parts of a toolset for every new victim became 
too time consuming, so somewhere around mid-2015, the attackers changed 
this scheme. Since June 2015 the Campaign ID is stored in a separate file named 
rbcon.ini, which the attackers call objectset. The malware authors have also 
included a new value called roboconid, which represents the Operator’s ID. Our 
investigation allowed us to confirm that this ID is a unique number for the mal-
ware operator, who performs cyber operations and is assigned to infect, spy on, 
and track a particular target.

Figure 16. Resources located inside the Prikormka dropper binary.

The dropper is responsible for creation of the rbcon.ini file, which used by the 
malware to store Campaign ID and other values.

Figure 18. The rbcon.ini file which contains both Campaign ID and Operator ID.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit

Some of the binaries of the dropper contain a PDB-path, which can reveal the 
directory structure used by attackers.

It should be noted that malware operators are responsible for deciding which 
modules should be pushed to the infected computer.

Prikormka might store modules with different functionality under similar names 
or, conversely, it can store modules with similar functionality under various names. 
Some versions of the malware store modules with a filename that contains only 
the current date and time. For these reasons we refer to the plugins by code 
names in the following text.

Figure 19. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka droppers.

The malware writers internally call this Trojan PZZ; we have other evidence that 
supports this theory. The Prikormka family is a typical cyber-espionage Trojan 
with a modular architecture. The functionality of the Trojan allows attackers to 
steal sensitive data from the infected computer and upload them to command and 
control (C&C) servers.

Prikormka modules

The Prikormka modules are stored on disk in the infected system in the form of 
DLL files. There are modules for various purposes, such as communication with 
C&C servers, auxiliary purposes (e.g. persistence), and exfiltration of different 
types of sensitive information from the infected computer. As mentioned before, 
Prikormka modules are compiled for both 32- and 64-bit Windows platforms.

There is a standard set of downloadable modules with pre-defined names, which 
will be described in detail in the next sections. So as to be executed, the module 
(DLL file) should be stored under a specific filename on the disk and should have 
one of the following export functions: Starting, KickInPoint, Cycle. However, 
attackers are able to push any custom module to a particular victim. Specifically, 
we observed that custom modules are usually named mp.dll.

The following list contains filenames of modules that were referenced within mal-
ware code, but we haven’t seen them during our research and thus were unable to 
assess their functionality:

•  miron.dll
•  meta.dll
•  hmuid.dll
•  sh.exe
•  mupdate.exe

It is important to note that Prikormka components made in the "old" period (be-
tween 2008 and 2010) used a completely different naming scheme. Here are some 
examples of such filenames:

•  smdhostn.dll
•  heading.dll
•  lgs.dll
•  la.dll
•  lh.exe
•  lp.exe
•  inl.exe
•  lid.dll 

PERSISTENCE module 

As described above, this module uses the DLL load-order hijacking technique to 
maintain persistence in the system.

When launched, this module creates the folder %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\
MMC and copies the following files there from the %WINDIR% directory:

•  hauthuid.dll (CORE)
•  hlpuctf.dll (KEYLOGGER)
•  atiml.dll (LOGS _ ENCRYPTER)
•  iomus.dll (DOCS _ STEALER)
•  swma.dll (SKYPE)
•  helpldr.dll (DOWNLOADER)
•  rbcon.ini

This component then loads and passes execution to the CORE module, or to the 
DOWNLOADER module if the CORE module is not found.

If the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\nullstate.cfg file exists, then the 
component deletes all the filenames listed above from the MMC directory and 
quits, thus deactivating itself.

Some of the binaries of the PERSISTENCE module contain a PDB-path, which re-
veals the directory structure used by the malware authors at compile time. Three 
of these paths contain a time stamp, possibly from when the project was created 
or modified. One such path contains the Russian string Раб. программы, which 
translates as “computer programs for work”.

Figure 20. Some of the PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's PERSISTENCE module.

DOWNLOADER module

The main purpose of this component is to download the CORE module and ex-
ecute it. The DOWNLOADER module makes an HTTP request to one of its C&C 
servers, receives data, decrypts the data, saves it under the name hauthuid.dll 
and then loads the DLL. The communication is encrypted with the Blowfish cipher 
and then base64 encoded.

Figure 21. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's DOWNLOADER module.

Along with the Campaign ID and Operator ID, the module includes in the request 
a date and time when infection occurred and whether the platform is 32-bit or 
64-bit Windows. Some of the binaries of the DOWNLOADER module contain PDB-
paths, revealing that internally this module is called Loader or helpldr:

Figure 22. PDB-paths discovered inside Prikormka's DOWNLOADER module.

CORE module 

The CORE module is responsible for communications with C&C servers and other 
tasks, including downloading additional modules, loading them, and uploading 
stolen data to the remote server.

Since this malware (and specifically the CORE module) has existed for several 
years, the details of implementation might vary, but the main concept of the CORE 
module has remained unchanged over the years. The concept of the Prikormka 
malware is simple: the CORE module downloads additional components, which 
are used to harvest various types of data. When such a component is loaded, it 
gathers sensitive information and saves this information to some specific log file. 
The log file might store collected data in plain-text or it may be encrypted. The 
CORE module checks periodically for such log files and when a log is available, it 
uploads it to the remote server. The CORE module won’t upload a log file if it is 
bigger than 500MB.

In order to store downloadable modules and collected log files, the CORE module 
creates two directories:

•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit 

17

The MMC folder is primarily used for additional downloadable malware compo-
nents; the SKC folder is used for storing collected log files. In the subsequent text 
we will use the term “log folder” to refer the SKC directory.

The downloadable modules are not able to upload collected data. In fact, only the 
CORE and DOWNLOADER modules communicate with C&C servers. The commu-
nication protocol of the CORE module is very similar to that of the DOWNLOADER 
module. 

It is worth mentioning that early versions of Prikormka stored C&C servers in 
plain-text; later, attackers used the base64 algorithm in order to hide the servers’ 
addresses. Finally, the latest versions of the CORE modules use simple encryp-
tion: to decrypt it, the researcher should add the hexadecimal value 0x17 to each 
encrypted byte.

Figure 23. Traffic captured from the Prikormka malware's CORE module.

The only difference between DOWNLOADER and CORE HTTP requests is the st 
parameter in the URL. This parameter indicates which of the downloadable mod-
ules are active and loaded by Prikormka. With the current implementation, there 
is room for 11 additional modules. The server responds with the content of the 
module that should be executed, or with a dummy answer. 

The logs are uploaded during a POST request to a similar URL:

•  hxxp:/server.ua/wd.php?sn=%DATE _ TIME _ OF _ INFECTION%

Figure 24. Example of simple encryption used by Prikormka to hide C&C servers.

DOCS_STEALER module 

This module is responsible for collecting documents from removable media or 
fixed drives, connected via a USB interface.

The module focuses on collecting files with document-type extensions: .DOC, 
.XLS, .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPT, .PPTX, .PPS, .PPSX, .PDF, .RTF, .TXT, .ODT. However,  
it does not collect all files, but only those which were modified in the last 7 days  
(or 14, or 30, depending on which version of the module).

The collected files then are compressed, encrypted with Blowfish, and stored  
under the following scheme:

•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ioctl\%DISK _ ID%\ 

%DATE% _ %TIME%.kf

KEYLOGGER module

SKYPE module 

This module is responsible for collecting keystrokes and the titles of foreground 
windows. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the following 
names:

•  %DATE% _ %TIME% _ fix.lg
•  lgfix
•  lpl
•  fplid
•  fmmlg

If the log file is bigger than 10Mb, the module removes the log and starts anew. 
Some versions of the module encrypt the log file using Blowfish.

SCREENSHOTS module 

This module is responsible for capturing screenshots of the victim’s desktop. 
By default, the module captures a screenshot every 15 minutes. However, if the 
victim opens a VoIP application Skype or Viber, then the period between screen-
shots is lowered dramatically to 5 seconds. The captured screenshot is saved in the 
JPEG format. The collected information is saved to the log folder under filenames 
%DATE% _ %TIME%.tgz.scrsh or %DATE% _ %TIME%.stgz.

MICROPHONE module 

This module is responsible for recording sound from a microphone. The module 
records audio with 10 minutes duration. It stops recording on command, or when 
there is no more free disk space available. The recorded audio is encoded with the 
LAME MP3 encoder. The collected information is saved to the log folder under the 
filename %DATE% _ %TIME%.snm.

This module is responsible for recording Skype audio chats. In order to record 
Skype calls, the module uses a legitimate interface, called the Skype Desktop API. 
When a third party application is about to use this API, the Skype messenger 
displays a warning, which asks the user to allow the access. To bypass this Skype 
security feature, the Prikormka module creates a thread that attempts to find the 
window and click the “Allow access” button programmatically, without human 
interaction.

Figure 25. The warning displayed by Skype.

The strings and some code fragments in this Prikormka module suggest that the 
implementation of this module was partly borrowed from the code published on 
the website openrce.org in 2006.

After encryption, the original (but not the encrypted) files are deleted. Results of 
the encryption are stored in the following files:

•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\ipl
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\kpl

The encrypted content is additionally encoded with the base64 algorithm. Inter-
estingly, before the content starts, the module puts an additional signature there:

Figure 26. The string CREATE APPLICATION minishell suggests copied-and-pasted code.

The collected information is saved to the log folder using %DATE% _ %TIME%.skw 
and _ skype.log filenames.

LOGS_ENCRYPTER module

Figure 27. The “atKsoft” signature at the beginning of encrypted log files.

This module is responsible for log encryption. The module compresses data via the 
LZSS algorithm and encrypts the following log files with Blowfish:

We have not found any legitimate application which can read such files or any 
other meaning of this mysterious “atKsoft” signature.

•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\inf
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\fsh
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.scrsh
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.snm
•  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SKC\*.skw
•  Files listed in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MMC\ierdir.dat

The file ierdir.dat is created by the CORE module; it contains an encrypted list 
of files requested by attackers to upload from victim’s computer.

GEOLOCATION module

This module is responsible for geo locating the infected computer. Unlike other 
modules, this module is written in the C# programming language. This module 
collects information about currently available WiFi networks, including Service Set 
Identifier (SSID) and MAC-address. Afterward, the module makes a request to the 
Google service, providing collected information as parameters; the Google service 
response contains the possible location based on the information supplied. 

The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename  
geo%DATE%.inf.

The binary of the GEOLOCATION module has a PDB-path; the structure of this 
path is similar to the PDB-path of the DOWNLOADER module:

Figure 29. The PDB-path discovered inside the GEOLOCATION module.

OS_INFO module

This module is responsible for collecting information about the infected computer.

The following information is collected by this module:

•  Battery info for Notebooks

•  Windows OS version

•  Computer name and User name

• 

IP Addresses and MAC Addresses

•  Physical memory

•  Available disk drives

•  Available printers

•  Desktop resolution

The module uses Windows API functions in order to collect this information.  
The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename 
%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.

PASSWORDS module

FILE_TREE module

This module is responsible for collecting passwords stored in applications installed 
on the infected computer.

The module gathers the application version, logins and passwords stored in the 
following applications:

•  Google Chrome

•  Opera Browser

•  Yandex Browser

•  Comodo Dragon Internet Browser

•  Rambler Browser (Nichrome)

•  Mozilla Firefox

•  Mozilla Thunderbird

For some reason, this module does not collect passwords for Microsoft Internet 
Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers. Because the Yandex Browser and the 
Rambler Browser are popular mostly in Russian speaking countries, we think that 
it indicates that this module was designed for use against users located in such 
countries. 

The collected information is saved to the log folder under the filename 
%DATE% _ %TIME%.inf.

This module is responsible for collecting information about the file system of the 
computer's fixed drives, including paths of files with specific file extensions, their 
size and creation time. The actual content of the file is not collected by this module.

The attackers are interested in the following file extensions: 

•  Documents: TXT, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF

•  Archives: ZIP, RAR

•  Databases: DB, SQLITE

•  The Bat! email client: TBB, CFG, CFN, TBN, TBB

•  Microsoft Outlook: OST, PST

•  Other: DAT, WAV, EXE 

Since The Bat! email client is popular in Russian-speaking countries, the fact that 
malware is focused on file extensions associated with this email client is another 
indicator that the malware is created with the intention of using it against Rus-
sian-speaking users. 

It should be noted that the list of all file extensions does not represent the list 
found in any particular sample. This list contains all the possible file extensions 
that we observed in different versions of the FILE_TREE module. The attackers 
might build a custom version of this module for a specific victim. The collected in-
formation is saved to the log folder under the filename %DATE% _ %TIME% _ tree.
inf. Some binaries of FILE_TREE modules have PDB-paths; one such path reveals 
the username of the malware writer.

C&C servers

During our investigation we obtained access to an Operation Groundbait C&C 
server that was misconfigured and allowed a public directory listing.

During our research into Operation Groundbait we have observed a number of 
C&C server domain names and IP addresses. Most of them are located in Ukraine 
and are hosted by Ukrainian hosting providers. Appendix B contains a more com-
prehensive listing.

One of the C&C servers, gils.ho[.]ua has been in operation since 2008, accord-
ing to information from the hosting company. In order to hide their illegal activity, 
the attackers created a bogus website. The website is dedicated to the capital of 
Ukraine—Kiev.

Figure 32. Operation Groundbait C&C server 

directory listing.

Figure 33. The internal directory structure 

of a subfolder.

At one point, the root directory contained 33 subdirectories, with an individual 
folder for each victim. This means that the server was used to control 33 Priko-
rmka-infected computers. The name of each sub-folder contains an Operator ID, 
a Campaign ID and the architecture of the infected device.

Each folder contains two sub-folders with the following names: data and util.  
The first folder contains encrypted exfiltrated data and the second folder has  
encrypted Prikormka modules.

Figure 31. Bogus website created by attackers.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit 

23

In addition to the data and util folders, each victim-specific subfolder contained 
two plain-text log files: journal and log, revealing interesting findings about the 
malware operators and their victims.

The log file contains the communication log between the server and the infected 
computer: specifically, the IP address of the infected computer, date and time, type 
of request (GET or POST), the size of request, and the status of Prikormka modules 
(in cases where it is a GET request).

Figure 34. The content of one log file located on the Operation Groundbait C&C server.

The journal file contains the communication log between the server and the 
malware operator. The communication log contains the IP address of the operator, 
the date, time, and type of request. It should be noted that once downloaded by 
the malware operator, the file with exfiltrated data gets removed from the server.

Figure 35. The content of the journal file located on an Operation Groundbait C&C server.

According to our analysis of the communication logs from one server there were 
33 victims, located mostly in Eastern Ukraine. In addition to those, there were 
a few victims located in Russia or in Kiev, Ukraine. 

The analysis of logs revealed that several malware operators connected to the 
server using various internet service providers in Kiev and Mariupol. Some of them 
accessed the C&C via the Tor network.

Attribution

In this section we make an attempt to identify the origin of the threat based on 
clues that were intentionally or unintentionally left by the attackers:

•  Most of Prikormka's C&C servers are located in Ukraine and hosted 

by Ukrainian hosting companies

•  The group behind this threat has fluent knowledge of the Russian 

and Ukrainian languages, as evidenced by text in the decoy 
documents and malware binaries

•  Some of the PDB-paths revealed that attackers used directories with 

names in Russian 

•  All analyzed Prikormka droppers contained language codes that 
correspond to Ukrainian (hexadecimal code 0x0422) or Russian 
(0x0419) languages in their PE resources (Figure 37)

•  The compilation timestamps of Prikormka binaries suggest that the 

malware authors operate in the Eastern European time zone

•  According to C&C server logs, a number of malware operators 

participating in Operation Groundbait have been making 
connections through various internet providers in two Ukrainian 
cities: Kiev and Mariupol.

Operation Groundbait: Analysis of a surveillance toolkit 

25

Interestingly, the droppers from earlier period (2012-2015) do contain resources 
with Russian language codes. The malware authors gradually switched from Rus-
sian to Ukrainian in the mid of 2015. 

We can deduce from this that the malware authors work from 6.00 to 16.00 (UTC), 
sometimes staying late in the evening. This corresponds to the period 8.00 to 18.00 
Eastern European Time, which would include normal Ukraine working hours.

Based on our research and the abovementioned facts, we conclude that the at-
tackers behind Operation Groundbait are people with an interest in surveillance 
or spying on separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and a few specific 
high-profile targets, including Ukrainian politicians. The malware operators and/
or authors have a knowledge of the Ukrainian and Russian language, and likely 
operate from within Ukrainian borders.

Figure 38 depicts the distribution of the compilation hour of Prikormka samples.

Conclusion

Our research into these attack campaigns and the Prikormka malware itself sug-
gests that this threat is the first publicly known Ukrainian malware that is being 
used in targeted attacks.

In terms of technical advancement, the attackers didn’t demonstrate any sophis-
ticated methods or novel techniques. But whether an attacker uses sophisticated 
methods or not does not matter as long as they reach their ultimate goal: stealing 
the sensitive information they need from their targets.

The most noteworthy achievement accomplished by the attackers behind  
Operation Groundbait is that they have stayed under the radar for over 7 years. 
The malware has been seen in the wild since at least 2008. This finding is con-
firmed by the timestamps of binaries, ESET telemetry, and by hosting providers used.

Operation Groundbait is, after BlackEnergy and Operation Potao Express, yet another 
demonstration that that using highly targeted malware for espionage amidst an 
armed conflict is an everyday reality.

Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that can be used to identify an infection can be 
found in Appendix B or on github.
