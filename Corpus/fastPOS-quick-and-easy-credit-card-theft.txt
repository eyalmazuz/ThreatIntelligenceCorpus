Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

Introduction 

Regardless of size and industry, an organization or a company can be affected by Point-of-Sale 
(PoS) threats. For more than three years, we have monitored and reported PoS threats 
targeting diverse verticals beyond retail; we have seen attacks affecting airports and parking 
lots, among others. It is a mainstream threat that has continuously evolved its tactics to expand 
their target base.  
 
While PoS threats have similarities in terms of techniques, each variant has its own unique 
characteristic. Take the case of this newly discovered PoS malware which is notable for its 
speed in how the information is stolen and sent back to attackers. We call this malware 
FastPOS, due to the said speed and efficiency of its credit card theft capabilities. 
 
In this technical brief, we will cover the infection vectors of FastPOS, its information theft 
routines, and its novel way of conducting data exfiltration.  
 
 
Installation 

Based on the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network data, the operators behind FastPOS used 
the following three infection vectors to install this threat: 
 

  A  compromised medical website that serves as a download location 

  A web-based, real-time file sharing service used as download location 

  Direct file transfer via virtual networking computer (VNC); we assume that access to this 

is either through stolen credentials or through a brute-force attack 

 
Earlier versions of FastPOS require an administrative account to run the file. A pop-up box 
appears if a non-administrative account runs the file:  
 

Figure 1: pop-up to run the file as administrator

Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

This pop-up box forces the users to manually circumvent the user account control (UAC), built 
on Windows Vista® and higher. After running the file with an administrative account, the copies 
of the malware are copied to the following locations: 
 

  %Windows%\system32\winlogon_r.exe (Windows 32-bit) 

  %Windows%\SysWOW64\winlogon_r.exe (Windows 64-bit) 

Running the file would result to a pop-up box indicating that the installation has been completed:  
 

 

Figure 2: Pop-up box of initial installation 

 

 
In the later versions of FastPOS, we observed that the cyber crooks removed the requirement to 
run as administrator but preserved the “Installation Complete” pop-up box. This made infection 
easier as the end-user is no longer required to be logged on as administrator. Based on the 
updated file set that we have, a copy of the malware is placed in the following locations: 
 

  %ProgramData%\cssrs.exe (Windows Vista® and above) 

  %ALLUSERPROFILE%\cssrs.exe (Windows XP) 

The “Installation Complete” pop-up box may be seen as a simple effort to avoid automation or 
sandbox execution that could possibly thwart full infection. Real infection, however, would still 
require clicking on the said pop-up box in order to pass the control to the newly written file. 
Aside from copying the file to the desired location, this threat has other indicators: 
 

  Creation of the mutex, “uniqyeidclaxemain” 

  Creation of an autorun entry, csrss = {malware path and filename} under 

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 

After the initial execution, file invoking, and successful installation, this threat connects to a 
command-and-control (C&C) server that is predefined in the file itself. The complete list of C&C 
servers can be found at the Appendix.

Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

Information theft routines 

FastPOS has three separate threads, pertaining to its notable capabilities:  
 

  Keylogger 

  Main RAM scraper process 

(Note: The latest file set avoids several process names: Firefox.exe, Chrome.exe, 
Svchost.exe, Dwm.exe, and Skype.exe) 

  Self-updating mechanism 

 
The first two threads, the keylogger and the main RAM scraper process, are for information theft 
purposes. We will tackle the third thread in the data exfiltration phase.  
 
In the first thread, FastPOS captures keystrokes and sends back the entire string to the C&C 
server once the return key is pressed.  Keyloggers often go together with PoS threats as the 
former enable the attackers to do reconnaissance and obtain other information aside from the 
stolen data from the credit card scrape. Stolen information from keyloggers may also vary 
between the products or services purchased and the card security code (unique card code/card 
identification number) being asked in some establishments.  
 
FastPOS implements a simple key-logging functionality similar to another PoS threat, 
NewPosThings, in that keylogged data are held in memory with no file written in disk.  As such, 
this poses challenges to detection and removal of the malware from PoS systems.  Although, 
such routine may result to some level of network noise, there are relatively few instances of the 
return key being used.  This is also seen when you compare the normal operations of PoS 
terminal to that of a regular workstation.  
 
The main RAM scraping process handled by the second thread and a custom algorithm is 
implemented in the following flow: 
 

1.  Check field separator ('=' or 'D') 
2.  Check first digit of the primary account number (aka, primary account number or 

PAN) (3,4,5,6) 

3.  Check expiry year (not later than 2040) 
4.  Check expiry month (no value above 12) 
5.  Service code should be 201 or 101 (magnetic stripe card/IC card, PIN not required) 
6.  Must pass Luhn validation 
7.  Data after service code should be digits from 0-9 up to 16 characters, and ends with 

'?'  

3 

Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

This process also checks if the number of digits is 16 numbers. The PAN checking indicates 
that it allows cards from major players like American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, and 
VISA among others. The steps taken by this RAM scraper is quite common, except to one 
procedure where it checks the service code. Based on our analysis of one particular sample 
(sha1: 01cdb9f7935434df31196660a7542e0b46bcf480), FastPOS looks for a specific service 
code 201 or 101, namely: 

  Position 1, value 1: International interchange OK 
  Position 1, value 2: International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible 
  Position 2, value 0: Normal 
  Position 3, value 1: No Restrictions 

 

Figure 3: Service code checking 

 

This filtering ensures that the credit card data that it searches for are international cards 
(position 1), unrestricted for authorization (position 2), and does not require a pin (position 3). A 
full list of possible service code combinations can be read here.  
 
 

Data exfiltration 

This RAM scraper has an unusual way of data exfiltration. It does not have any HTTP user-
agent. Instead of HTTP POST, the HTTP GET verb is used. This implies that a server would 
have to do post-processing on their server-side logs. GET method is usually employed to 
request data from a specific HTTP resource while POST is for submitting data to the specified 
HTTP resource. Analysis of the HTTP responses indicates that a positive HTTP 200 response is 
given by the C&C server – meaning that the HTTP GET request is processed correctly. 
However, no content is provided back to the client from the server.

Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

Figure 4. HTTP GET request to C&C server 

  

 
Furthermore, because of the use of HTTP GET, the requests are cached on the infected 
endpoints and remain in web browser history. FastPOS either deletes the URL cache entry to 
handle the cached content or when it attempts to update using the third thread for self-update.  
 
Aside from implementing HTTP GET (instead of HTTP POST) on the client-side, the command 
and control server does not implement HTTPS to encrypt the traffic. This makes the requests 
and responses, including the credit card data, exposed in the network traffic. In turn, this makes 
the network traffic easy to spot as it exposes all gathered information from the endpoint in every 
HTTP transaction. However, this threat does so in a quick and easy manner, hence the name 
FastPOS.  
 
Typically, PoS threats either log data locally or send it out to their respective C&C servers 
immediately. In the case of FastPOS, it does not store any scraped information or status logs 
locally but sends it to C&C server hard-coded in the malware. It does this using the following 
commands/parameters: 
 

key&log=TWND%sKWND%s 

add&log=%s&foundin=%s  

Used to send the logged keystrokes. First 
string is the window title; second string is the 
key log 
Used by the RAM Scraper thread during data 
exfiltration. First string is the card dump; 
second string is the process name.  

Table 1. Commands for sending the stolen information 

It also continuously sends status logs to the C&C server using the parameters listed below:

Table 2. Parameters for sending logs 

FastPOS has implemented a functionality that indicates the process name where the credit card 
is found. This is usually used to pre-filter if the entry is valid or not. They can also reuse this 
later for profiling purposes or for determining the PoS software running on the infected terminal.  
 
 

Other research findings 

We found interesting hints or clues regarding the perpetrators behind FastPOS and its possible 
users. We spotted a forum site which has a code snippet with the exact mutex as FastPOS 
when configured to use.  
 

Figure 5:  This forum site has the same mutex name 

The error message (see figure 6) bears semblances to the pop-up box in our sample set.

Figure 6: Pop-up box when the mutex is duplicated 

 

We surmise that the user who posted in the said forum, inquiring about the keylogger is actually 
the creator of FastPOS. There’s a possibility that he is employing the platform and its user base 
to refine his code.  The said code in question appears like the FastPOS keylogger thread.

Our research also indicated that around January 24-25 of this year, there were advertisements 
of a site called SwipeIt[.]pw in some forums with this content.  
 

Figure 9: SwipeIt[.]pw advertisement 

 

Ironically, the IP address (5[.]100[.]156[.]107)of SwipeIt[.]pw is actually used as the C&C server 
of this threat. Perhaps, the operators behind FastPOS thought it would be simple as to make the 
forum as the C&C server where they can also sell their wares.  
 
This forum also provides information about the dumps available for purchase. It also allows the 
users to add balance to their accounts, view and filter existing dumps, check the existing credit 
card bins, view the FAQ page, and access chat-based technical support page. All transactions 
are done in bitcoin only.

The site also provides information regarding the current locations these cybercriminals are 
looting. Our findings show that the current locations are South Korea, United Kingdom, and 
Brazil.  
 
Based on our research findings, here’s a rough timeline of the events related to this.

Although the two domains (aquaspa-oi[.]re and sabebien[.]cl) were registered some time ago, 
these were just recently observed with FastPOS. 

 

Affected countries 

Our Smart Protection Network data shows the following countries have FastPOS-related 
infections in the last five months.  

Figure 12.  Country distribution of FastPOS-related infections 

Trend Micro has observed infections in small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), as well as 
enterprises.  We also surmise that the locations which have FastPOS infections are sometimes 
the remote offices with open remote VNC access. 

 

 

 

Conclusion 

Some of the affected entities of FastPOS are based in locations with open remote VNC access.  
In certain instances, these organizations have DSL router as their primary separation between 
the terminal (that processes credit card information) and the internet with just port-forward 
functionality enabled directly to the terminal itself. This introduces risks to the environment given 
that there’s only a thin line separating the terminal and external access. While remote access 
allows remote administration, the same channels have always been abused. A similar 
methodology has been seen and documented early on with point-of-sale systems infected by 
Backoff with in this advisory from US-CERT almost 2 years ago which, as it stands to show, 
similar methodology are still being used on infections still persist today.

Trend Micro | FastPOS: Quick and Easy Credit Card Theft 

Furthermore, based on the design and behavior of FastPOS, it implies that the targeted 
terminals have bare internet access with installed endpoint security software as the only line of 
defense. While complying with the bare minimum of having anti-malware software on systems, it 
is recommended to separate traffic and employ strict access controls on such terminals.  
In cases when an endpoint security solution is used to secure systems against PoS threats, it 
also best to track and monitor activities within the endpoint. Implementing a context-aware 
endpoint security monitor that would speed up the discovery, investigation and response to 
security incidents may be desired such as Trend Micro Endpoint Sensor.  
 
 

 

Figure 13. Visual representation of the infection via Trend Micro Endpoint Sensor 

Businesses should also consider another approach, such as implementing endpoint application 
control or whitelisting technology that reduces attack exposure by ensuring only updates 
associated with whitelisted applications can be installed. Endpoint solutions such  Trend 
Micro™ Security,  Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites, and  Trend Micro Worry-
Free™ Business Security can protect users systems have features that can help in combatting 
PoS threats such as FastPOS.
