‘One-Stop Shop’ – Phishing Domain Targets Information from Customers of Several Indian Banks
November 30, 2016 | by Santhosh Ramanchandran, Sudeep Singh
FireEye Labs recently discovered a malicious phishing domain designed to steal a variety of information – including credentials and mobile numbers – from customers of several banks in India. Currently, we have not observed this domain being used in any campaigns. The phishing websites appear to be in the earlier stages of development and through this post we hope users will be able to identify these types of emerging threats in the future.

FireEye phishing detection technology identified a newly registered domain, “csecurepay[.]com”, that was registered on Oct. 23, 2016. The website purports to offer online payment gateway services, but is actually a phishing website that leads to the capturing of victim logon credentials – and other information – for multiple banks operating in India.

Prior to publication, FireEye notified the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team.

Phishing Template Presentation and Techniques
Step 1
URL: hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/load-cash-step2.aspx

When navigating to the URL, the domain appears to be a payment gateway and requests that the user enter their bank account number and the amount to be transferred, as seen in Figure 1. The victim is allowed to choose their bank from a list that is provided.

By looking at the list, it is clear that only Indian banks are being targeted at this time. A total of 26 banks are available and these are named in the Appendix.

Step 2
URL:  hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/PaymentConfirmation.aspx

The next website requests the victim to enter their valid 10-digit mobile number and email ID (Figure 2), which makes the website appear more legitimate.

Step 3
The victim will then be redirected to the spoofed online banking page of the bank they selected, which requests that they log in using their user name and password. Figure 3 shows a fake login page for State Bank of India. See the Appendix for more banks that have spoofed login pages.

After entering their login credentials, the victim will be asked to key in their One Time Password (OTP), as seen in Figure 4.

Step 4
URL: hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/Final.aspx

Once all of the sensitive data is gathered, a fake failed login message will be displayed to the victim, as seen in Figure 5.

Credit and Debit Card Phishing Website
Using the registrant information from the csecurepay domain, we found another domain registered by the phisher as “nsecurepay[.]com”. The domain, registered in latest August 2016, aims to steal credit and debit card information.

The following are among the list of cards that are targeted:

1.     ICICI Credit Card

2.     ICICI Debit Card

3.     Visa/Master Credit Card

4.     Visa/Master Debit Card

5.     SBI Debit Card Only

At the time of this writing, the nsecurepay website was producing errors when redirecting to spoofed credit and debit card pages. Figure 6 shows the front end.

Conclusion
Phishing has its own development lifecycle. It usually starts off with building the tools and developing the “hooks” for luring victims into providing their financial information. Once the phishing website (or websites) is fully operational, we typically begin to see a wave of phishing emails pointing to it.

In this case, we see that phishing websites have been crafted to spoof multiple banks in India. These attackers can potentially grab sensitive online banking information and other personal data, and even provided support for multifactor authentication and OTP. Moreover, disguising the initial presentation to appear as an online payment gateway service makes the phishing attack seem more legitimate.

FireEye Labs detects this phishing attack and customers will be protected against the usage of these sites in possible future campaigns.
